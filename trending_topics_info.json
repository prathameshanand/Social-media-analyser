(I.e. instead of water bottles?) \n\nI\u2019ve heard of water-skins, and I have a rough understanding of them, but are there other methods or examples of products used back then? I\u2019m writing a story that\u2019s fantasy based, so it doesn\u2019t entirely accurate to any time period or country, but I wanted an idea of survival gear that a character might be carrying around with them. I realized, I have little to no idea what they\u2019d use instead of a water-skin (which is fine, but not the vibe I\u2019m going for) or maybe a sealed glass bottle (which seams silly to travel long distances with if there is a better options.\n\nNo wrong answers, just an idea I\u2019ve been rolling around in my head.",

Slave auctions would be held and their health and such would be examined beforehand. Sure, this could easily be faked but in general it's not good business. The slaves that were weaker, less healthy, might still be bought at a reduced cost. \n\nAs for traders it didn't really matter. It was more about the numbers. If a large enough percent survive the journey and end up healthy enough to sell then they'll make a profit. Many would die along the way and they'd simply be thrown overboard. \n\nAs for practices, basically think of any way you could try and sell a horse while hiding its issues to someone who isn't a veterinarian. The few examples that likely didn't happen to horses is sometimes the slaves would be given a bit of alcohol to make them a bit more lively looking. But yeah they would try and hide as much as they could.",

                                "comment": "Like the other poster, I'm assuming this is about the transatlantic system, but there's a big difference between what slave traders were doing and what slave masters were doing. It's easy to find descriptions of slave auctions in the US where they clearly did look at the people's teeth, made them walk, etc, to assess their health because it was a significant, and usually long term, investment. Walter Johnson's Soul by Soul is a good book for this aspect.\n\nSlave traders is a much different question. There are lots of links in the slave trading line, so it depends on where they are. You mention ships, so I'm assuming you want information about the trading forts in places like Elmina on the coast of Africa. Slave traders do want healthy people who will stand a better chance of surviving the journey, the typical transatlantic voyage had about a 20% mortality rate. That will maximize their profit. But they have several constraints. Able bodied men sell for the most, with children and old people selling for the least. Women sell for less than men, but in a range depending on their age. But, children are small so you can cram more of them into your hold. Ideally you would maximize your profit by getting boys who are on the cusp of puberty b/c you can take more and the increased number will offset the lower cost. They also are less susceptible to disease than younger children. \n\nBut that is contingent on simple factors like who is available for transport at a given facility. If there are only older people, or only sick people because you came at the wrong time of the year, your choices will be limited. Or, if the season is almost up to catch the tradewinds, you are under more pressure to take what's available. Also, if you've waited too long (and ships would linger on the coast of Africa for months buying people to take) and your human cargo is starting to sicken, it might make sense to just grab who you can and go. \n\nSo, there was lots of thought put into it, with a preference for boys around 13 to 15 years old, but that's all contingent on the time year, what enslaved people were available, and the condition of the enslaved people already in your hold, and how long you've been lingering off the coast. Steven Mintz works on childhood in early America and he's got a nice short essay on the topic. https://chnm.gmu.edu/cyh/case-studies/57.html",

Few outside are aware that the Nazis forced her and her family to relocate to Theresienstadt transit camp/ghetto in Czechoslovakia when she was 13 years old. I spent a few months reporting, researching and interviewing her and her family. When you consider the circumstances she faced, it's nothing short of a miracle that she, her twin brother, mother and father survived the Holocaust. I thought it was important to tell her story as we're losing so many of these folks as each month/year goes by. [Gift link here.](https://wapo.st/4hM1nNG)",

                        "comment": "Hi!  \nAs we hope you can appreciate, the Holocaust can be a fraught subject to deal with. While we don't want to curtail discussion, we also remain very conscious that threads of this nature can attract the very wrong kind of responses, and it is an unfortunate truth that on reddit, outright Holocaust denial can often rear its ugly head. As such, the /r/History mods have created this brief overview. It is not intended to stifle further discussion, but simply lay out the basic, incontrovertible truths to get them out of the way.\n\n##What Was the Holocaust?\nThe Holocaust refers to the genocidal deaths of 5-6 million European Jews carried out systematically by Nazi Germany as part of targeted policies of persecution and extermination during World War II. Some historians will also include the deaths of the Roma, Communists, Mentally Disabled, and other groups targeted by Nazi policies, which brings the total number of deaths to 11-17 million. Debates about whether or not the Holocaust includes these deaths or not is a matter of definitions, but in no way a reflection on dispute that they occurred.\n\n##But This Guy Says Otherwise! \nUnfortunately, there is a small, but vocal, minority of persons who fall into the category of Holocaust Denial, attempting to minimize the deaths by orders of magnitude, impugn well proven facts, or even claim that the Holocaust is entirely a fabrication and never happened. Although they often self-style themselves as \"Revisionists\", they are not correctly described by the title. While revisionism is not inherently a dirty word, actual revision, to quote Michael Shermer, *\"entails refinement of detailed knowledge about events, rarely complete denial of the events themselves, and certainly not denial of the cumulation of events known as the Holocaust.\"*\n\nIt is absolutely true that were you to read a book written in 1950 or so, you would find information which any decent scholar today might reject, and that is the result of good revisionism. But these changes, which even can be quite large, such as the reassessment of deaths at Auschwitz from ~4 million to ~1 million, are done within the bounds of respected, academic study, and reflect decades of work that builds upon the work of previous scholars, and certainly does not willfully disregard documented evidence and recollections. There are still plenty of questions within Holocaust Studies that are debated by scholars, and there may still be more out there for us to discover, and revise, but when it comes to the basic facts, there is simply no valid argument against them.\n\n##So What Are the Basics?  \nBeginning with their rise to power in the 1930s, the Nazi Party, headed by Adolf Hitler, implemented a series of anti-Jewish policies within Germany, marginalizing Jews within society more and more, stripping them of their wealth, livelihoods, and their dignity. With the invasion of Poland in 1939, the number of Jews under Nazi control reached into the millions, and this number would again increase with the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. Shortly after the invasion of Poland, the Germans started to confine the Jewish population into squalid ghettos. After several plans on how to rid Europe of the Jews that all proved unfeasible, by the time of the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, ideological (Antisemitism) and pragmatic (Resources) considerations lead to mass-killings becoming the only viable option in the minds of the Nazi leadership.\nFirst only practiced in the USSR, it was influential groups such as the SS and the administration of the General Government that pushed to expand the killing operations to all of Europe and sometime at the end of 1941 met with Hitler\u2019s approval.\n\nThe early killings were carried out foremost by the *Einsatzgruppen*, paramilitary groups organized under the aegis of the SS and tasked with carrying out the mass killings of Jews, Communists, and other 'undesirable elements' in the wake of the German military's advance. In what is often termed the 'Holocaust by Bullet', the *Einsatzgruppen*, with the assistance of the Wehrmacht, the SD, the Security Police, as well as local collaborators, would kill roughly two million persons, over half of them Jews. Most killings were carried out with mass shootings, but other methods such as gas vans - intended to spare the killers the trauma of shooting so many persons day after day - were utilized too. \n\nBy early 1942, the \"Final Solution\" to the so-called \"Jewish Question\" was essentially finalized at the Wannsee Conference under the direction of Reinhard Heydrich, where the plan to eliminate the Jewish population of Europe using a series of extermination camps set up in occupied Poland was presented and met with approval.\n\nConstruction of extermination camps had already begun the previous fall, and mass extermination, mostly as part of 'Operation Reinhard', had began operation by spring of 1942. Roughly 2 million persons, nearly all Jewish men, women, and children, were immediately gassed upon arrival at Be\u0142\u017cec, Sobib\u00f3r, and Treblinka over the next two years, when these  \"Reinhard\" camps were closed and razed. More victims would meet their fate in additional extermination camps such as Che\u0142mno, but most infamously at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where slightly over 1 million persons, mostly Jews, died. Under the plan set forth at Wannsee, exterminations were hardly limited to the Jews of Poland, but rather Jews from all over Europe were rounded up and sent east by rail like cattle to the slaughter. Although the victims of the Reinhard Camps were originally buried, they would later be exhumed and cremated, and cremation of the victims was normal procedure at later camps such as Auschwitz.\n\n##The Camps  \nThere were two main types of camps run by Nazi Germany, which is sometimes a source of confusion. Concentration Camps were well known means of extrajudicial control implemented by the Nazis shortly after taking power, beginning with the construction of Dachau in 1933. Political opponents of all type, not just Jews, could find themselves imprisoned in these camps during the pre-war years, and while conditions were often brutal and squalid, and numerous deaths did occur from mistreatment, they were not usually a death sentence and the population fluctuated greatly. Although Concentration Camps *were* later made part of the 'Final Solution', their purpose was not as immediate extermination centers. Some were 'way stations', and others were work camps, where Germany intended to eke out every last bit of productivity from them through what was known as \"extermination through labor\". Jews and other undesirable elements, if deemed healthy enough to work, could find themselves spared for a time and \"allowed\" to toil away like slaves until their usefulness was at an end.\n\nAlthough some Concentration Camps, such as Mauthausen, did include small gas chambers, mass gassing was not the primary purpose of the camp. Many camps, becoming extremely overcrowded, nevertheless resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of inhabitants due to the outbreak of diseases such as typhus, or starvation, all of which the camp administrations did little to prevent. Bergen-Belsen, which was not a work camp but rather served as something of a way station for prisoners of the camp systems being moved about, is perhaps one of the most infamous of camps on this count, saw some 50,000 deaths caused by the conditions. Often located in the Reich, camps liberated by the Western forces were exclusively Concentration Camps, and many survivor testimonies come from these camps.\n\nThe Concentration Camps are contrasted with the Extermination Camps, which were purpose built for mass killing, with large gas chambers and later on, crematoria, but little or no facilities for inmates. Often they were disguised with false facades to lull the new arrivals into a false sense of security, even though rumors were of course rife for the fate that awaited the deportees. Almost all arrivals were killed upon arrival at these camps, and in many cases the number of survivors numbered in the single digits, such as at Be\u0142\u017cec, where only seven Jews, forced to assist in operation of the camp, were alive after the war.\n\nSeveral camps, however, were 'Hybrids' of both types, the most famous being Auschwitz, which was vast a complex of subcamps. The infamous 'selection' of prisoners, conducted by SS doctors upon arrival, meant life or death, with those deemed unsuited for labor immediately gassed and the more healthy and robust given at least temporary reprieve. The death count at Auschwitz numbered around 1 million, but it is also the source of many survivor testimonies.\n\n##How Do We Know?  \nRunning through the evidence piece by piece would take more space than we have here, but suffice to say, there is a lot of evidence, and not just the (mountains of) survivor testimony. We have testimonies and writings from many who participated, as well German documentation of the programs. [This site](http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.de/2012/10/index-of-published-evidence-on.html) catalogs some of the evidence we have for mass extermination as it relates to Auschwitz.

My biggest pet peeve with historical documentaries and podcasts (and books) is that they tend to be focused only on men - and in particular on the violence caused by men. To me, it's much more interesting learning about what people ate, what they wore, how they practiced their religion, how they built their houses, how they farmed, etc etc. \n\n  \nThe BBC's historic farm shows (and their off-shoots, like the castle and the bakery ones) are the ultimate to me, and Ive been searching high and low for ages for something with a similar topic.

McCoy - Alterations of State**\n*Kings were sacred \ufb01gures for centuries in Europe, perceived as the Lord\u2019s anointed deputies on earth. The Church and its sacraments were considered holier than the monarchy, but medieval rulers were still thought to have sacerdotal, spiritual, and even miraculous powers. Coronation was seen by some as a sacrament, akin to ordination; the royal touch was thought to have healing effects; and the mystical conception of the king\u2019s two bodies implied that kingship never died. Moreover, rulers from Charlemagne to the Hapsburgs had claimed imperial autonomy from the papacy, causing tension between kings and clerics. The Reformation intensi\ufb01ed this con\ufb02ict while vastly expanding older notions of sacred kingship, making them simultaneously more grandiose and more problematic. In England, Henry VIII\u2019s break with Rome was justi\ufb01ed by new theories of royal supremacy that made the king the head of the church and clergy as well as the spiritual embodiment of the realm.\nAs the Reformation advanced, even the sacraments themselves were diminished and the Mass suppressed. These developments caused what John Bossy calls \u201ca migration of the holy\u201d in which \u201cthe socially integrative powers of the host\u201d were transferred \u201cto the rituals of monarchy and secular community.\u201d Under the Tudors, the royal presence acquired some of the awesome sanctity of Christ\u2019s real presence in the Eucharist and at times even threatened to replace it.\nRood screens were dismantled and sometimes replaced with the royal coat of arms under Edward, and the feast of Corpus Christi was eventually suppressed and superseded by a cult of Elizabeth and its annual royal processions. Both old and new ideas of sacred kingship still provoked increasing ambivalence and even hostility, and challenges and con\ufb02icts intensi\ufb01ed throughout the Reformation.*\n\n\n**Urszula Szulakowska - The Sacrificial Body and the Day of Doom**\n*Martyrdom was believed to resource the Church with the spiritual wealth of divine grace, the foundation for its future development on earth.\nAccording to this doctrine, the \ufb02esh was the ground of human salvation, its torment a necessity, whether in life as a martyr for Christ, or after death in the state of purgation.\nIn medieval doctrine it was the Church alone that could authorise the survival of the subject (that is, the body) by ensuring that the soul and its temporary somatic body went either to Purgatory, or (infrequently) directly to heaven through the grace of the Church\u2019s sacraments.*\n\n\n*It was Luther who \ufb01rst identi\ufb01ed the Papacy with Antichrist and, on this basis, Lutheran artists had crowned the head of the Whore of Babylon with the papal tiara, as in the Wittenberg Bible of 1522. Furthermore, they equated the Pope with the Beast from the Bottomless Pit. The standard apocalyptic repertoire was created in Luther\u2019s immediate social circle by Lucas Cranach in his woodcuts for the Passional Christi und Antichristi (1521) and for Luther\u2019s Septembertestament (1522).*\n\n\n*Some Paracelsian alchemists, especially Heinrich Khunrath (ca. 1560\u20131605) and Stefan Michelspacher (active ca. 1615\u201323), were objects of persecution on the part of both Lutheran and Catholic authorities. Khunrath was an alchemist from Saxony, the heartland of the Reformation, but his theological stance was characteristic of the second generation of Protestants who felt that Luther\u2019s work had been left incomplete and that another religious reform was essential.*\n\n\n*Dissenters from the established Protestant Churches were important precursors of a secular society, tolerant of religious divisions, in which Church and state were separated. In characterising these dissidents,\nS\u00e9guenny has adopted a concept from the philosopher Leszek Kolakowski, that of \u201creligion without a Church\u201d. I would add that a little known aspect of the history of secularism is the role of Paracelsian theosophy in creating a heterogeneous society supporting noncompliant religious views.*\n\n\n\n\n**Renko D. Geffarth - Religion und arkane Hierarchie**\n*The reception of the Kabbalah, Platonism and Hermeticism in the German-speaking world ultimately gave rise to the early modern concept of magic of Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa von Nettesheim and subsequently, with the integration of alchemy, the Paracelsian natural philosophy, the theosophy of Jakob B\u00f6hme and the panosophy of the Rosicrucian writings of the 17th century. All of this was always in interplay and conflict with Christianity and its denominations, which also persecuted such heterodox currents as heresy.*\n\n\n*Following the example of the Paracelsian Philosophia ad Athenienses, Robert Fludd constructed a cosmology based on the Paracelsian concept of the divine spirit in nature.*\n\n\n*In response to earlier doubts about his religious beliefs, Fludd had written the Declaratio Brevis to King James I in 1618-20. The alchemical appropriation of the Christian sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper was not welcomed by the ruling churches. None of them could accept a chemistry that claimed to produce substances that were equivalent to the body and blood of Christ and granted the same grace of spiritual and physical healing. The miracle of the bread and wine in the mass or communion service was unique and could never be imitated by chemical means, no matter how devout and prayerful one was. Moreover, none of the churches allowed unauthorized laymen to perform the sacramental rite, which was the prerogative of priests who had been formally appointed by a bishop by direct apostolic delegation from Christ. If, like Fludd, they introduced cabalistic angels (especially Metatron) into the alchemical version of the rite, he was, as Mersenne claimed, considered a practitioner of the most heinous demonic magic. The good or bad intentions didn't matter: it was a question of who should control this powerful miracle.*\n\n\n*Schl\u00f6gl also emphasizes the enlightened character of the esoteric secret societies, as they represented an \"alternative to the salvation economy of the Christian churches\" with their efforts to redeem 'creation' in this world and therefore accommodated the \"self-confidence of people at the end of the 18th century\".*\n\n\n*In an overview essay on the Illuminati Order and the Gold and Rosicrucians in 1993, the Munich historian and professor Ludwig Hammermayer once again emphasized the contrast between the 'radical Enlightenment' Illuminati and the 'theocratic' Rosicrucians.*",

With the help of the secret brotherhood of the Rosicrucians, these three core issues were now to be subjected to a renewal that followed a uniform 'world view'. The Rosicrucian manifestos and the discourse that took place in the years following their first publication were thus not only the mediators of an early modern esoteric tradition that drew on the physician and hermeticist Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim, known as Paracelsus (1493- 1541), and the hermeticism of the Renaissance, but also an expression of the perception of the crisis of the early 17th century.*\n\n\n*These first years after the publication of the Manifestos are considered the period of the 'older' Rosicrucians, followed by a 'middle' period resulting from the translation of the writings into other European languages and their reception in other countries, especially in England; the beginning of this second period is generally placed around the middle of the 17th century and its duration is extended into the early 18th century.\nFor the 'middle Rosicrucians', there is initial speculation about actually existing brotherhoods or even just circles of people who considered or described themselves as Rosicrucians; for example, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz is said to have been a member of a circle of alchemists and Rosicrucians. However, it is still true for this phase of 'Rosicrucianism' that a real society, an order comparable to that of the late 18th century, very probably did not exist.*\n\n\n*The history of the development of Freemasonry presented in the following section does, however, show influences from the reception of Rosicrucian writings in 17th century England, which were passed on via Elias Ashmole (1617-1692), a member of the Royal Society founded in 1660 and one of the early Freemasons. The chronological order chosen in this study, 'Older Rosicrucians' - Freemasons - Gold and Rosicrucians, is therefore based on the well-founded assumption that there was a connection in terms of content between the Rosicrucian manifestos and early Freemasonry, just as there was a structural connection between 18th century Freemasonry and the Order of the Gold and Rosicrucians.*",

                "selftext": "A copper threshing ground (\u043c\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e \u0433\u0443\u043c\u043d\u043e) or a copper pagan temple (\u043c\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e \u043a\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0449\u0435) is noted in medieval writings, usually regarding Danube Bulgars, their political power, statehood and pagan religion. It's also mentioned (albeit rarely) in Bulgarian folklore. I couldn't find many English sources regarding this, so here I'll put down some information that I've discovered in Bulgarian (there aren't any sources in other languages).\n\nThe first mentions of a copper threshing ground are found in Byzantine sources dating back to the times when Danube Bulgars still existed and were pagan. Joseph Genesius's writings mention a threshing ground where Bulgar children are killed by triumphant Byzantines in the early 9th century, and in \"The Letter of the Three Patriarchs to Emperor Theophilos\", the Byzantine emperor Leo V (ruled 813-820) is told by a man named Sabbatios that if he destroys all icons, he will finally have prosperity and will stab his sword into the Bulgars' copper threshing ground.\n\nIn the 10th-11th century, many Christians in Europe were expecting the end of the world, so apocryphal eschatological literature saw a rise. We owe several mentions of a copper threshing floor to Bulgarian apocryphs. Those were written in the style of the biblical Book of Revelation or used Old Testament motifs, but the characters, places and symbols were often local.\n\nIn the apocryphal work \"\u0422\u044a\u043b\u043a\u0443\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e\" (\"Danail's interpretation\"), a copper pagan temple is mentioned. It's linked to Bulgar pagan religion by Bulgarian historians and its destruction by the character \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u043a\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d (Mihail khagan, identified by some with Boris I Mihail) symbolizes the Christianisation of Bulgaria. Mihail khagan goes on to fight and dethrone an \"evil king\" who abuses Christians (identified with Vladimir Rasate). The apocryph also describes battles in which he participated.\n\nAlthough pagan temples' ruins have been discovered in Pliska, the capital of pagan Bulgaria, copper hasn't been found. Either the copper was stolen and the threshing floor was destroyed during invasions, or it was a metaphor.\n\nIn a different apocryph, \"\u0412\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043a \u0414\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0438\u043b \u0437\u0430 \u0446\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0442\u0435, \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0434\u043d\u0438 \u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u043a\u0440\u0430\u044f \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430\" (\"Vision of prophet Danail regarding the kings, the last days and the end of the world\") similar events are described, but instead of a copper pagan temple, there's a copper threshing ground. The name and title of the person who breaks the copper threshing ground aren't mentioned, but he's extraordinary. Wars are also noted (\"brother against brother\"), they might be the rebellion of the aristocraticy during the Christianisation of Bulgaria and the clash between Vladimir Rasate and his father.\n\nA copper threshing ground is referenced in another 11th century Bulgarian medieval apocryph, \"\u0421\u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043a \u0421\u0430\u043c\u0443\u0438\u043b\" (\"\u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e \u0421\u0430\u043c\u043e\u0438\u043b\u0463 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0440\u043a\u0430\", \"Word regarding prophet Samuel\"). Here, it's not linked with Bulgars, but instead, it appears in Nebuchadnezzar's dream and the prophet tells him that it symbolizes the world. It could signify what it meant to Bulgars and early Bulgarians - perhaps a model of the world or a symbol of the world.\n\nAs the Danube Bulgars assimilated into the Slavs, notions of a copper threshing ground survived in Bulgarian folklore. There's a riddle that goes \"beans sown on a copper threshing ground, an old man watches over them\" and the answer is the stars, the sky and the moon. A ritual song describing an unborn yet male child places the child on a horse that goes around a golden pole in the middle of a copper threshing ground. According to ethnologists, the horse, the copper threshing ground and the golden pole symbolize Ursa Minor, the sky and the Polar star. According to historian Marin Drinov, rare mentions of copper (and metal) threshing grounds have been recorded in the folklore of other Slavs, as well as in Greek folklore. However, according to historian Ivan Venedikov, the origins of the copper threshing ground are Bulgar, as there aren't any notions of such a thing in Greek or Slavic mythology, therefore the idea must've spread in the Middle ages. (Mentions in Macedonia in particular might be due to Kuber's Bulgars, but it's not proven 100%.)\n\nHowever, this raises several questions.\n\n1. How did Danube Bulgars come up with the copper threshing ground/copper temple? Was/is there any other steppe tribe that had/has anything similar? I've read about Volga Bulgaria, but notions of a copper threshing ground/copper temple are never recorded there. Both medieval Bulgarian states descend from Old Great Bulgaria, so I assume they must've had similarities at their founding, before they got influenced by the different religions that they converted into, by their neighbours and by the tribes that they incorporated.\n\n2. Why did it have to be copper in particular? Could it be that oxidized copper turns turquoise and therefore reminds them of the sky and Tangra? (Sky also gets orange hues in sunrise/sunset, like non-oxidized copper.)\n\n3. Why did Danube Bulgars pick a threshing ground in particular to represent their statehood, power and pagan religion? Bulgars were semi-nomadic, a threshing ground is not the first thing you'd associate with a semi-nomadic people.\n\n\n\n\nSources:\n\n\n\u0414\u0440\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432, \u041c. \u041c\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e (\u0431\u0430\u043a\u044a\u0440\u043d\u043e) \u0433\u0443\u043c\u043d\u043e, \u043c\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0442\u043e\u043a \u0432 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u0438 \u0433\u0440\u044a\u0446\u043a\u0438 \u0443\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u2014 \u0412: \u0421\u044a\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f, \u0422. 2, \u0421., 1911.\n^ an article in Bulgarian by historian Marin Drinov regarding the copper threshing floor among Slavs and Greeks, I couldn't find it online, so I can't give a link\n\n\n\u0412\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u0418\u0432. \u041b\u0435\u0433\u0435\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0437\u0430 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0438\u043b \u043a\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d. \u2014 \u0412: \u0421\u0431. \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432. \u0422. 2. \u0421., 1976.\n^ an article in Bulgarian by historian Ivan Venedikov regarding \"Mihail khagan\", I couldn't find it online, so I can't give a link\n\n\n\u0412\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432, \u0418\u0432. \u041c\u0435\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0442\u043e \u0433\u0443\u043c\u043d\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435. \u0421., 1983\n^ a book by Ivan Venedikov called \"The copper threshing ground of the Bulgars\" where, among other things, he analyzes the copper threshing ground, I think it can be found online, you will have to use auto-translate\n\n\nhttps://liternet.bg/publish/tmollov/mei/6_1.htm\nhttps://liternet.bg/publish/tmollov/mei/6_2.htm\nhttps://liternet.bg/publish/tmollov/mei/6_3.htm\n^ three articles in Bulgarian by Bulgarian philologist and ethnology professor Todor Mollov where he discusses the copper threshing ground, Mihail khagan and the apocryphs, you can use auto-translate if you're interested in the articles\n\n\nhttps://dokumen.pub/the-letter-of-the-three-patriarchs-to-emperor-theophilos-and-related-texts-1-871328-12-8.html\n^ source is in English, \"The Letter of the Three Patriarchs to Emperor Theophilos\" (oddly, the threshing floor is called brazen here, but maybe it's the translation, I've seen it as copper in Bulgarian, I wanted to find the Greek original and see what kind of word they use there, but I couldn't)\n\n\nhttps://archive.org/details/genesios-1998-english-kaldellis-byzantium-813-886\n^ source is in English, writings of Joseph Genesius, threshing floor is mentioned on page 14, this might be a description of Leo V's victory against Bulgars during kanasubigi Omurtag's reign, or a confabulation of Nicephorus I Genik's destruction of Pliska; Leo V has never entered Pliska",

                "selftext": "I recently started researching the role of M\u0101ori women in securing the vote and was surprised by how little recognition they receive\u2014especially outside Aotearoa (New Zealand). One name that stood out to me was Meri Te Tai Mangak\u0101hia, a pioneering M\u0101ori suffragist whose contributions deserve more attention.\n\nNew Zealand is often celebrated as the first country in the world to grant women the right to vote in national elections (1893). However, this achievement is usually credited to the mainstream suffrage movement, which was largely led by P\u0101keh\u0101 (white) women and focused on securing voting rights within the British colonial political system. What is less discussed is that M\u0101ori women were engaged in their own struggle for political representation\u2014one that was deeply tied to the survival of their communities, land rights, and sovereignty.\n\nIn 1893, the same year New Zealand granted women the vote, Meri Te Tai Mangak\u0101hia became the first woman to address Te Kotahitanga, the M\u0101ori Parliament. Her speech was groundbreaking\u2014not only did she advocate for M\u0101ori women\u2019s right to vote, but she also called for their right to stand for election, something the mainstream suffrage movement wasn\u2019t even fighting for at the time. She argued that many M\u0101ori women were landowners and decision-makers within their own communities but lacked the political power to protect their interests. In the face of ongoing colonial dispossession, securing representation wasn\u2019t just about gender equality\u2014it was about ensuring the survival of M\u0101ori as a people.\n\nMeri\u2019s efforts helped M\u0101ori women win the right to vote in Te Kotahitanga elections in 1897. However, the M\u0101ori Parliament itself was never fully recognized by the colonial government and was eventually dismantled in the early 1900s, limiting the impact of these gains. Meanwhile, when M\u0101ori men were granted the right to vote in New Zealand\u2019s national elections in 1867, they were only allowed to vote in separate M\u0101ori electorates, a system that remained in place for M\u0101ori voters\u2014including women\u2014after 1893. This meant that while all women in New Zealand gained the right to vote that year, M\u0101ori women\u2019s political participation remained constrained by structural inequalities that continued long after suffrage was won.\n\nDespite her contributions, Meri Te Tai Mangak\u0101hia\u2019s legacy is often overshadowed. Even within New Zealand, her name is far less known than that of Kate Sheppard, the leader of the P\u0101keh\u0101 suffrage movement. This marginalization is reflected in the country\u2019s national suffrage memorial in Christchurch, where Meri is the only M\u0101ori woman depicted\u2014positioned at the side of the five P\u0101keh\u0101 suffragists.\n\nThis raises a broader question: whose stories do we center when we talk about progress? The fight for women\u2019s political rights didn\u2019t look the same everywhere, and in many places, it wasn\u2019t a unified movement. The voices of Indigenous women, women of color, and those advocating outside mainstream feminist spaces are still often pushed to the margins.\n\nMeri Te Tai Mangak\u0101hia\u2019s story is a reminder that (feminist) history is more complex than the dominant narratives suggest.

When P\u0101keh\u0101 women gained the right to vote in the New Zealand Parliament later that year, there was debate over whether M\u0101ori women should also have the right. Her speech and activism were cited as part of the argument for including M\u0101ori women, which ultimately ensured that they were not excluded.\n\nAs for the Kauhanganui, the governing body of the K\u012bngitanga (M\u0101ori King movement), women not only had the right to vote but also actively participated as members. This was quite progressive for the time, especially considering that most Western parliaments still denied women such rights.\n\nI\u2019m curious about the \u201cmultiple competing M\u0101ori parliaments\u201d you mentioned\u2014besides Kotahitanga and the Kauhanganui, I haven\u2019t come across much about others. What sources or examples do you have in mind? Would love to learn more!\n\nNg\u0101 mihi \nNikos",

It seems like we only have records dating to the 15th century or so identifying coffee (ignoring folk legends about a certain shepherd and his hopped-up herd).  \n  \nContrast this with tea, a preparation with a history of thousands of years. Or tobacco, which may have been used even longer in the Americas. \n\nSo I'm wondering: what took so long? Why did humans live with coffee cherries for so long and never experiment with cooking them until recently? Why are some edible plants widespread while others languish?",

                                "comment": "That really is an excellent question to open on! Thank you! Part of the reason I have spent so much time working on the BPP is because I agree with you that the broad assumption remains that the BPP was only about guns and violence, despite dozens of historians proving that this was not the case. Like you suggest, this popular image is largely due to the FBI and the police's sustained campaign against the BPP. We also have to acknowledge the role that racist assumptions about Black violence play in this.  \n\nAt another level, I also think that part of this comes from the BPP's image, which was defined in part by Eldridge Cleaver, who was behind the famous image of Huey P. Newton in the wicker chair and Newton and Bobby Seale outside the first BPP office. Both images prominently feature guns, which casual viewers simply equate with violence, despite both images being far deeper and much more complex. Of course, once people start to read the BPP's theory of the gun, they realise that it represents a deterrent rather than aggression, and was designed to prompt police officers to think twice about their brutalizing of Black American people. The BPP noticed early on that, once they started patrolling the police, police violence decreased. Newton was also adept at reminding police that, should they use their weapons, then he would use his. This he took from the great radical activist Robert F. Williams. But I wonder whether many people are given the opportunity to read more about the BPP.\n\nTo go back to your main question, I sincerely hope that we will get to a better awareness about the BPP's significance. But the power imbalances in society are such that this is something that we all have to work on.\n\nHope this answers your question!",

There's so much to unpack, I think I'll do a few bullet points (not necessarily in chronological order, or exhaustive, so please feel free to add your own):\n\n1) San Francisco emerged in the C19 as a port and as a hub for prospectors. It always had its rough edges -- see the Committees of Vigilance, for example (which I touch on in *Dirty Harry's America*) -- and had quite an 'anything goes' atmosphere at times. Many of the early white inhabitants (\\*let's not forget that the land was originally occupied by the Ohlone peoples\\*) went there to remake themselves, which surely influenced their (and their descendants') relationship with change (in the abstract sense). \n\n2) As one of my excellent graduate students (among other historians), Gabe Hogg, revealed, San Francisco had a vibrant union movement in the early C20, that was informed by leftist thought. We overlook the importance of trade unionism at our peril!\n\n3) As the major embarking and disembarking point in WW2, it was the place where sailors and soldiers who were discharged dishonorably (quite a euphemism there...) would land. If they didn't -- or couldn't -- head home, they would set up their new lives nearby. This fed into the antiestablishment atmosphere.\n\n4) Oakland had a huge union movement, both in the shipyards and the railroads. As a major terminus, it was for example the location of the headquarters of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (A. Philip Randolph, architect of the March on Washington, was their central figure). \n\n5) We see a lot of migration of Black southerners to the Bay Area during the Great Migration. As the excellent historian Donna Murch revealed, many future BPP members were sons or daughters of these migrants. I wonder whether the familial experience of migration -- which involves changing the circumstances that are around you -- might have influenced these young people to make different sorts of changes to their circumstances. In this, I wonder whether they chose to change politics rather than geography. \n\n6) I'm perhaps stretching things here, but the San Andreas and Hayward Faults might have an impact. Their instability means that Bay Area dwellers live under the permanent threat of massive ruptures to their lives, and I wonder whether that might impact on their way of seeing the world. If you know that the world around you can easily be remade by tectonics, why not try it yourself? OK, so I know what you're thinking here -- has Street gone mad? -- but if we accept that the built and natural environment around us impacts on our way of seeing the world, why \\*wouldn't\\* something like the threat of earthquake do so too?\n\n7) There are loads of other things, some of which are structural, some happenstance, some a bit random, and this is what I love about the Bay Area! We could add, for example, the Howl trial and the Beats, Cal's Berkeley campus, the great science fiction writer Philip K. Dick (who was always writing about reality changing around us), the vibrant radio culture (that helped nurture Sly Stone among many others) etc. etc. \n\nI don't think I've arrived at a unifying theory of Bay Area change here (you'll note that I've ignored Richmond, Antioch, the south of the Bay, etc. etc.) but I hope the above includes some sketchy notes towards it!",

Much of the writing on the BPP focuses on their Marxist borrowings (with some anarchist tinges here or there), but much of black radical intellectualism also consisted of a tradition of liberal republican (small-r) critique. I am thinking here of figures like Frederick Douglass, Anna Julia Cooper, Alain LeRoy Locke and in more recent times figures like Charles W. Mills and Kwame Anthony Appiah.",

The real answer to your question would require a book-length inquisition!\n\nFor me, you're right that there are clear intersections between the BPP and Marxist and Black Marxist thought. Frankly, I don't think anybody can understand BPP thought without making reference to Marxism. In terms of the intersections you mention, there are definite intersections with Anna Julia Cooper (I'm thinking here of her critique of the myopia of white feminist thought in ignoring the intersectional prejudice faced by Black women) and we might also espy links with the Sojourners for Truth and Justice (particularly their internationalism). \n\nThinking more deeply, I wonder about the BPP's relationship with liberal republicans. If you look at documents like the early Executive Mandates and of course the BPP's relationship with the Second Amendment, you can see a deep understanding of the Declaration of Independence and of course the American Constitution. In this, I suspect that the BPP did not see the political concept of the USA as fundamentally flawed, but instead that racism and what we might term the praxis of American democracy as a departure from the ideals espoused in these foundational documents. I suspect that Douglass and other folk would nod in agreement here. \n\nI would love to hear what you think about this issue though! Please tell me more.",

It's a good one, and one that is increasingly on my mind now that it is becoming more difficult to enter the US.\n\nIn terms of the work for Black Revolutionaries, I was immensely lucky in that my university purchased microfilm copies of the BPP's organisational records. As far as I know, we're the only British university to hold them. I can't overstate how much this helped, as it meant I could research from home, and indeed, I spent countless hours poring over microfilms. Without this resource, I'd have been at the mercy of the big funding bodies in the UK, who aren't as wealthy as they might be. One day, hopefully, the originals (which are held at Stanford U) will be digitized and made available for all to see. Likewise, the people at the Marxists Internet Archive made the vast majority of the BPP's newspaper available online. I also have a few hard copies at work, courtesy of my friend and colleague Prof Brian Ward. This is, hands down, the best source for understanding the BPP, and I frequently get lost in its pages. (It's also a wonderful teaching tool: my students always say that the best session in my BPP module is the one where I bring in copies of the newspaper for them to read. On reflection, this doesn't say much for my teaching skills, does it?!)\n\nThe other big impediment is a bit more personal and relates to oral histories. Many, many years ago, I did an oral history with a member. It was an amazing experience, but once I went through my tapes (yes, it was that long ago that I recorded it on a cassette -- ask your grandparents what they were) I realised that I was just too awestruck by being in the company of somebody who I had admired so much that I wasn't really any good at asking them questions! Thankfully, in the years since then, many many more experienced and talented historians have conducted some wonderful oral histories and have made them available online. I am totally in their debt. \n\nBeyond this, there's a major question about whether somebody with my experience and identity (a white, middle-class man from the UK) can truly understand what it meant to be a Black person in Oakland (or the other locations in which the BPP was active) during the 1960s and 1970s. I hope that readers of the book will develop their own conclusions about this important question, one that is always present when I'm writing about the BPP.",

Can't fault it, as my Grampy would say.\n\nAnyway, to the question, there are so many things about the school breakfast program that historians have identified as important but that remain largely underappreciated. For example, did you know that J. Edgar Hoover said it was the most dangerous part of the BPP's overall program? That says everything you need to know about Hoover. Feeding children is apparently dangerous...\n\nAs important, we have to think about how many local school districts adopted free breakfast programs in the wake of the BPP doing it. As a number of historians have noted, the BPP was a pioneer in acknowledging the importance of children going to school on a full stomach, and how hunger prevents learning. We can't underestimate this. Kids: if you're reading, eat your breakfast!\n\nMore seriously, we also have to think about how dedicated members of the BPP collected food from local businesses, cooked, fed, and then packed off to school thousands of kids. That is a huge organizational feat in itself. Using the surplus goods that emerge from capitalism was a work of genius, in my book. Critics, like Hoover, said that the BPP would use the breakfast program as propaganda, both to soften the image of the BPP and brainwash the children. I often wonder about reversing this: if this is the case, then why don't our governments offer free breakfasts to every kid?",

In the 60s, the US' School of the Americas developed a counterinsurgency and guerrilla warfare training and instruction system, based on the French Revolutionary War Doctrine from the 50s, which was widely applied by military dictatorships across Latin Am\u00e9rica during the 70s and 80s. Its primary goal was to encourage the use of the armed forces directly instead of solely relying on intelligence agencies and security forces in the fight against real - or perceived revolutionary groups. Do we know if the US government ever considered applying - or actively applied any of the active engagement or psychological warfare strategies outlined in this theoretical framework against the BPP?",

In terms of active engagement, much of the FBI's work involved infiltrators (some of whom were recruited like Earl Anthony because they'd committed a crime and the FBI used the threat of prosecution to have the infiltrators do their bidding; other times agents joined themselves). There's a lot of evidence to suggest that a number of dangerous activities engaged by the BPP came at the instigation of infiltrators.\n\nIn terms of psychological warfare, I think it's worth looking at the ways the police/FBI engaged in daily activities to unsettle the organization. This involved things like mysterious phone calls, phone tapping, tailing people, that sort of thing, which heightened the psychological pressure of being in the Party. \n\nTo be honest, I'm consistently amazed that the BPP managed to do anything given the sheer volume of repression directed at its members. This is testament to the heroism of each and every member.",

A terrible bit of fence-sitting, I'm afraid. If we compare it to the Weathermen, for example, we can see uniqueness in the breadth and depth of the BPP's vision for a different society, but similarities in their critique of American capitalism. The BPP was also far more disciplined and organized than the Weathermen -- we might turn to the 'Days of Rage' here, for evidence -- but both (to different extents) were aware that nonviolence was not providing the breakthroughs that many 1960s activists hoped it would\n\nA major difference lies in their experience of state repression: the FBI developed no serious sources within the Weather Underground, but the BPP was riddled with informers and agent provocateurs. We know that the vast majority of COINTELPRO resources were directed towards destroying the BPP, while the FBI failed to pay attention to other groups. This also speaks to the unique position that BPP members found themselves in, and here an intersectional approach is important, because we have to think about the repression they faced sitting at the intersection of many facets of their being: members were Black, often working-class or unemployed, many were female, and all were critics of the US system and members of an openly revolutionary group. As such, they faced a much more repressive environment than, say, a male, middle-class, university-educated friend of the Weather Underground. That naturally means that a BPP member's response to this unique position would itself be unique.\n\nThen we have to think about the BPP's relationship with other Black Power groups, which was often quite tense and related to differing understandings of the role of race in underpinning activism, one that the police and the FBI exacerbated for its own ends. But we also have to think of the BPP within the context of the times. Josh Bloom and Waldo Martin's history of the BPP, *Black Against Empire*, argues strenuously that the BPP cannot be separated from the atmosphere of the late 1960s (and particularly the War in Vietnam), and suggest that once the fervor of 1968 had waned, the BPP was almost doomed to collapse. So, they fit with the times really well, in addition to being unique. Argh, I'm on the fence again. Sorry about that.",

In terms of organizational links, we have to think of the BPP's drift from nationalism in 1967 and its increasing criticism of race-first approaches. The leading figures in the Party were also much bigger followers of Malcolm X, and we know about the tension between this group of people and the NoI. That said, Eldridge Cleaver was impressed by the way that the NoI organized Black prisoners and saw himself how they offered redemption to many men who struggled under the psychological weight of white supremacy and prison. He was briefly a Nation minister in prison, although like Malcolm X, he did not agree with the NoI's policy of avoiding interaction with formal politics.",

The organization was definitely constructed as a revolutionary one and we can see their praxis in the form of their community-building efforts and educational programs and liberation schools.\n\n\nWhat i am curious about is just how much of the body of sociaist/communist work was being taught by those schools/programs. There was the \"Panther Party Booklist\" that did feature american black socialists works, but i notice that some more \"foundational\" works of marx and lenin are not mentioned, which i find strange.\u00a0\n\n\nIn their pursuit of Point 5 of the Ten-Point Program, did the Party advance more traditional eduction on marxist-leninism beyond its relation to american black liberation? Did Newtons shift from Black Nationalism to his pursuit of intercommunalism result in a shift in the education policies of the Party to focus on a broader group (i.e. the proletariat) and their collective class struggle as opposed to the unique position of black americans?\u00a0",

I hope that the below suffices to start us off...\n\nI don't know for certain what went on during the educational programs (which I accept is one of my failings for not asking that question) but I'm fairly sure that a number of things were going on here:\n\nA great deal of the BPP's Marxism is filtered through their reading of Fanon's *The Wretched of the Earth*. This book was foundational for the BPP, and you can see its influence everywhere in the Party, particularly in the period between late 1967 and 1971. I insist my students read the book cover to cover, like members did. You can see directly how Fanon's understanding of the lumpenproletariat influenced the BPP's recruitment policies, how his thoughts about revolutionary education and culture fed into BPP praxis, and how his Marxist anticolonialism helped the BPP's internationalism and its understanding of internal colonialism. Given the depth and richness of Fanon, I'm not sure members needed much more!\n\nAs important, we have to see BPP philosophy moving through different phases. Initially you see a lot of Black nationalist ideas expressed in the newspaper. They gradually cede to a focus on class during 1968 before race returns when Newton re-appraises Black capitalism (a development that was intimately linked to a funding crisis for the Party). You might note that the 'class' period (and yes I'm oversimplifying here) coincides with Eldridge Cleaver's prominence in the Party. It's no coincidence. He was the most Leninist of the Party's central cadre (and was also a big fan of Nechayev's Catechism of a Revolutionary, which was reprinted in the newspaper at this time). I'm sure political education inside the Party broadly reflected these shifts.",

                                "comment": "Sure! Thanks for the question. I guess the first thing to say about FBI sources is that the people who wrote them are extremely good at one thing: identifying where the people they follow are. Of course, that is when they aren't lying about the location. As this suggests, we have to treat govt-sponsored sources about the BPP extremely cautiously, and I think it helps not only to think about them in terms of bias and racism but in terms of organizational culture. Within this, we have to center J. Edgar Hoover and think about how individual agents relate to him and his position, which helps to explain some of the racism that permeates FBI sources: Hoover was always pleased to hear stories that were suggestive of a lack of (his understanding of) morality among Black Americans. But we also have to think about how agents would advance their careers; one way to do this would be to heighten fears of, say, a BPP operation against the police. This might then lead to them receiving extra resources for oppressing the local Panthers, which would make any anti-BPP operations more successful, leading to career advancement. Once we understand this, we develop a much more complex impression of how and why the FBI portrayed the BPP as it did, especially after Hoover escalates the COINTELPRO. \n\nI think it's helpful to see police sources similarly, and to think about how the police fit into structures of power. For example, we know that Chicago police collaborated with friendly newspaper columnists to plant stories about the local BPP, which heightened fears in the local power structure and played a role in creating the circumstances that led to Fred Hampton's and Mark Clark's murder by Chicago police in December 1969.\n\nI think the other thing worth remembering is that only a fraction of the COINTELPRO documents remain. Many were destroyed in the early 1970s, and I think we can be pretty certain that many anti-BPP activities were not documented, which makes it all the more important that we preserve what we have and that we think deeply about the value of personal sources, which tell a very different story.",

The reason for these tests was to prevent disputes and blood feuds (in an era where such things were rampant). If a court of yeoman found your son guilty you might think they were wrong and seek vengeance against the accusor or jury. If God says your son is guilty, you are going to be god fearing enough to just accept the result.\n\nTypically the priest would sort out a rational judgement beforehand and then rig the test as needed to get the intended result.",
