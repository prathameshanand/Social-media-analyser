And 'tis said, according to Pete Rizzo, he that hath studied Bitcoin's lore of old, that this very whale, now possessed of four hundred million BTC shorts, doth wield 'all available margin,' in order to double down upon his perilous, short position.

Some brokerages allow traders to short certain instruments. They lend you the shares, you'll sell at the price they were loaned to you and buy them back at a lower price.  \nEveryone saying they want them to be liquidated is saying they want the price to rise so that the trader loses all their money.",

Then decide which is better as an investment vehicle and which would be better as a currency for everyday use by working-class people.\n\n---\n\n**Dogecoin vs. Bitcoin: Investment & Everyday Currency Comparison**  \n\n### **Bitcoin (BTC)**\n\u2705 **Pros:**  \n- **Established & Secure:** Bitcoin has the strongest network security and longest track record.  \n- **Scarcity & Store of Value:** With a hard cap of 21 million coins, BTC is deflationary, making it attractive as a hedge against inflation.  \n- **Institutional Adoption:** Many major companies and financial institutions recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset.  \n- **Decentralization:** Highly decentralized, making it resistant to censorship and government control.  \n\n\u274c **Cons:**  \n- **Slow & Expensive Transactions:** BTC\u2019s 10-minute block time and high transaction fees make it inefficient for small, daily purchases.  \n- **Not User-Friendly for Everyday Use:** Using Bitcoin for daily transactions can be cumbersome due to fees and processing delays.  \n- **Volatility:** While it\u2019s seen as digital gold, price swings can be extreme, making it difficult for budgeting or savings in the short term.  \n\n---\n\n### **Dogecoin (DOGE)**  \n\u2705 **Pros:**  \n- **Faster Transactions:** 1-minute block time makes DOGE much faster than Bitcoin for payments.  \n- **Low Fees:** Transactions cost a fraction of a cent, making it ideal for microtransactions.  \n- **Strong Community Support:** The Dogecoin community is vibrant and focused on everyday use and tipping.  \n- **More Accessible:** Due to its lower price per coin and inflationary nature, people feel more comfortable spending DOGE rather than hoarding it.  \n\n\u274c **Cons:**  \n- **Unlimited Supply:** No hard cap means continuous inflation, which discourages long-term holding as a store of value.  \n- **Security Concerns:** DOGE has fewer miners and a smaller network, making it more vulnerable to attacks.  \n- **Limited Adoption:** While growing, Dogecoin still lacks the widespread recognition and adoption that Bitcoin has.  \n\n---\n\n### **Which is the Better Investment?**  \n**Winner: Bitcoin** \ud83d\ude80  \nBTC\u2019s scarcity and institutional backing make it the superior investment vehicle. Its long-term value is more predictable, and it\u2019s seen as a hedge against inflation\u2014similar to gold. While volatile, its trajectory has historically trended upward, making it a strong choice for long-term investors.  \n\n### **Which is Better for Everyday Transactions?**  \n**Winner: Dogecoin** \ud83d\udcb0  \nDOGE\u2019s fast transaction speed and low fees make it far more practical for small, daily transactions. The working class benefits from low-cost, quick payments, making it ideal for tipping, remittances, and everyday spending. Bitcoin\u2019s high fees and slow confirmations make it impractical for casual transactions.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Verdict:**  \n- **Investment? Bitcoin.** \ud83d\udcc8  \n- **Everyday Currency? Dogecoin.** \ud83d\uded2",

They are going to be relying entirely on transactions fees. But if another currency were to take that place (dogecoin), there won't be enough transactions to support the miners without raising the fees astronomically which  leads to an endless spiral.\n\nSo what proof of work coin can survive as a store of value coin if dogecoin takes over the majority of the transactions? Litecoin is merge mined with dogecoin so when people mine dogecoin, they will also be securing the litecoin network, even if people do not transact in litecoin, allowing it to become the new store of value.",

Now in 2025 its once again at the start of a breakout from another three year all time high set in 2022. Trade wars tend to create economic uncertainty in traditional assets and thats what fueled Bitcoins bull run last time. Now its the same bs with tariffs and trade sanctions as last time to! Not to mention Ukraine funding has been cut and just a week or so ago the Bitcoin reserve went into effect. Stack a 10 year chart of dogecoin on top of a 10 year chart of bitcoin and you will see what im talking about. This dip aint sht it just seems that way because doge is the more volatile of the two. \r\n\r\n",

They can assist by generating code, but they don\u2019t validate assumptions, check time series properties, or perform real quantitative analysis like proper statistical or machine learning models. Running time series decomposition, tweaking hyperparameters, and executing an AI model is just running code\u2014without a solid understanding of the data, it\u2019s meaningless. As one of my professors once said, \"Garbage in, garbage out.\"\n\nApplying seasonal decomposition to Dogecoin is mostly pointless\u2014it follows Bitcoin. If you're looking for seasonality, analyze BTC instead. Dogecoin will mirror BTC\u2019s movements, but with more volatility and occasional independent spikes. Without proper human oversight, AI predictions in crypto are often just noise.",

Then decide which is better as an investment vehicle and which would be better as a currency for everyday use by working-class people.\n\n---\n\n**Dogecoin vs. Bitcoin: Investment & Everyday Currency Comparison**  \n\n### **Bitcoin (BTC)**\n\u2705 **Pros:**  \n- **Established & Secure:** Bitcoin has the strongest network security and longest track record.  \n- **Scarcity & Store of Value:** With a hard cap of 21 million coins, BTC is deflationary, making it attractive as a hedge against inflation.  \n- **Institutional Adoption:** Many major companies and financial institutions recognize Bitcoin as a legitimate asset.  \n- **Decentralization:** Highly decentralized, making it resistant to censorship and government control.  \n\n\u274c **Cons:**  \n- **Slow & Expensive Transactions:** BTC\u2019s 10-minute block time and high transaction fees make it inefficient for small, daily purchases.  \n- **Not User-Friendly for Everyday Use:** Using Bitcoin for daily transactions can be cumbersome due to fees and processing delays.  \n- **Volatility:** While it\u2019s seen as digital gold, price swings can be extreme, making it difficult for budgeting or savings in the short term.  \n\n---\n\n### **Dogecoin (DOGE)**  \n\u2705 **Pros:**  \n- **Faster Transactions:** 1-minute block time makes DOGE much faster than Bitcoin for payments.  \n- **Low Fees:** Transactions cost a fraction of a cent, making it ideal for microtransactions.  \n- **Strong Community Support:** The Dogecoin community is vibrant and focused on everyday use and tipping.  \n- **More Accessible:** Due to its lower price per coin and inflationary nature, people feel more comfortable spending DOGE rather than hoarding it.  \n\n\u274c **Cons:**  \n- **Unlimited Supply:** No hard cap means continuous inflation, which discourages long-term holding as a store of value.  \n- **Security Concerns:** DOGE has fewer miners and a smaller network, making it more vulnerable to attacks.  \n- **Limited Adoption:** While growing, Dogecoin still lacks the widespread recognition and adoption that Bitcoin has.  \n\n---\n\n### **Which is the Better Investment?**  \n**Winner: Bitcoin** \ud83d\ude80  \nBTC\u2019s scarcity and institutional backing make it the superior investment vehicle. Its long-term value is more predictable, and it\u2019s seen as a hedge against inflation\u2014similar to gold. While volatile, its trajectory has historically trended upward, making it a strong choice for long-term investors.  \n\n### **Which is Better for Everyday Transactions?**  \n**Winner: Dogecoin** \ud83d\udcb0  \nDOGE\u2019s fast transaction speed and low fees make it far more practical for small, daily transactions. The working class benefits from low-cost, quick payments, making it ideal for tipping, remittances, and everyday spending. Bitcoin\u2019s high fees and slow confirmations make it impractical for casual transactions.  \n\n---\n\n### **Final Verdict:**  \n- **Investment? Bitcoin.** \ud83d\udcc8  \n- **Everyday Currency? Dogecoin.** \ud83d\uded2",

They are going to be relying entirely on transactions fees. But if another currency were to take that place (dogecoin), there won't be enough transactions to support the miners without raising the fees astronomically which  leads to an endless spiral.\n\nSo what proof of work coin can survive as a store of value coin if dogecoin takes over the majority of the transactions? Litecoin is merge mined with dogecoin so when people mine dogecoin, they will also be securing the litecoin network, even if people do not transact in litecoin, allowing it to become the new store of value.",

While I\u2019m not new to Reddit itself, I haven\u2019t been active on it until recently\u2014maybe mid to late 2024. As someone new to the more in-depth aspects of Reddit culture, I wanted to give this community a try since Dogecoin is something I genuinely like.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve been debating whether to continue participating here. The negativity, trolling, and overall toxicity have been discouraging. I don\u2019t mean to sound like I\u2019m just complaining, but it feels like many posts here are just people tearing each other down instead of supporting one another. Instead of constructive discussions or insights, I see a lot of random, baseless \"technical analysis\" posts and unnecessary hostility.\n\nI often think to myself: *\"It\u2019s really not that hard to get along with one another.\"* Yet, it seems like people make it much more difficult than it needs to be. Maybe I joined this subreddit with the wrong expectations\u2014perhaps I thought it would be more about the community, positivity, and shared enthusiasm for Dogecoin. Instead, I see a lot of the opposite.\n\nI\u2019m not great at putting my thoughts into words, but I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this: Why did you join this subreddit? Was it because you genuinely like Dogecoin, believe in its potential, or wanted to be part of a supportive space? If so, wouldn\u2019t it make sense for us to build each other up rather than bring each other down?\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s all I have to say. I hope you all have a great day or night.\n\n**Much love.**  \n\\- IsolatedAndH8ted",

Honestly I'm with you about alot of this, but just try your best to be that light and be that change you wanna see both in this sub and this world:).

Not much wow that is. :-(\n\nI do have the exact address at hand where the Coins went to (starting with DGrbb9) and at 'Output, Spending Tx' the headline reads to this day 'Unspent'. So the Coins must still be around somewhere. But how to retrieve them? I dunno. Is anybody out there who can be excellent to me? This would be much wow. And there would be a nice reward, too.\n\n  \nPlease do get in touch, any solution would be much wow-preciated.\n\n",

But my guess would be that the coins were moved out of the wallet, just with a later transaction to a different wallet.\nMaybe even a history of different transfers to different wallets that also never arrived.",

                "selftext": "I originally joined this subreddit because I thought it would be an engaging community to be a part of. While I\u2019m not new to Reddit itself, I haven\u2019t been active on it until recently\u2014maybe mid to late 2024. As someone new to the more in-depth aspects of Reddit culture, I wanted to give this community a try since Dogecoin is something I genuinely like.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve been debating whether to continue participating here. The negativity, trolling, and overall toxicity have been discouraging. I don\u2019t mean to sound like I\u2019m just complaining, but it feels like many posts here are just people tearing each other down instead of supporting one another. Instead of constructive discussions or insights, I see a lot of random, baseless \"technical analysis\" posts and unnecessary hostility.\n\nI often think to myself: *\"It\u2019s really not that hard to get along with one another.\"* Yet, it seems like people make it much more difficult than it needs to be. Maybe I joined this subreddit with the wrong expectations\u2014perhaps I thought it would be more about the community, positivity, and shared enthusiasm for Dogecoin. Instead, I see a lot of the opposite.\n\nI\u2019m not great at putting my thoughts into words, but I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this: Why did you join this subreddit? Was it because you genuinely like Dogecoin, believe in its potential, or wanted to be part of a supportive space? If so, wouldn\u2019t it make sense for us to build each other up rather than bring each other down?\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s all I have to say. I hope you all have a great day or night.\n\n**Much love.**  \n\\- IsolatedAndH8ted",

It's either a team of people or a team of bots, brand new accounts out of nowhere saying they hold all the doge and are gonna sell because they cooked or something. Lol. Honestly I'm with you about alot of this, but just try your best to be that light and be that change you wanna see both in this sub and this world:). And that's What doge is all about, the light in the darlness.",

Perhaps, while out on walks or at the dog run, your dog will wonder where their friend is, that familiar butt to sniff, so, in that case, yes, your dog, too, would suffer.",

                "selftext": "I originally joined this subreddit because I thought it would be an engaging community to be a part of. While I\u2019m not new to Reddit itself, I haven\u2019t been active on it until recently\u2014maybe mid to late 2024. As someone new to the more in-depth aspects of Reddit culture, I wanted to give this community a try since Dogecoin is something I genuinely like.\n\nHowever, I\u2019ve been debating whether to continue participating here. The negativity, trolling, and overall toxicity have been discouraging. I don\u2019t mean to sound like I\u2019m just complaining, but it feels like many posts here are just people tearing each other down instead of supporting one another. Instead of constructive discussions or insights, I see a lot of random, baseless \"technical analysis\" posts and unnecessary hostility.\n\nI often think to myself: *\"It\u2019s really not that hard to get along with one another.\"* Yet, it seems like people make it much more difficult than it needs to be. Maybe I joined this subreddit with the wrong expectations\u2014perhaps I thought it would be more about the community, positivity, and shared enthusiasm for Dogecoin. Instead, I see a lot of the opposite.\n\nI\u2019m not great at putting my thoughts into words, but I guess what I\u2019m trying to say is this: Why did you join this subreddit? Was it because you genuinely like Dogecoin, believe in its potential, or wanted to be part of a supportive space? If so, wouldn\u2019t it make sense for us to build each other up rather than bring each other down?\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s all I have to say. I hope you all have a great day or night.\n\n**Much love.**  \n\\- IsolatedAndH8ted",

It's either a team of people or a team of bots, brand new accounts out of nowhere saying they hold all the doge and are gonna sell because they cooked or something. Lol. Honestly I'm with you about alot of this, but just try your best to be that light and be that change you wanna see both in this sub and this world:). And that's What doge is all about, the light in the darlness.",

Correlation doesn\u2019t always equal causation, BUT you can learn a lot about the market and your precious dog by zooming out. \n\nThe greed index is a component of how I like to time my DCA and hold onto my sanity. When the greed is highest, I don\u2019t like to buy as much. When fear is highest, I start to DCA again. I can also use this to time when I take profits. \n\nJust one of many strategies and opinions you\u2019ll find here on Reddit. Hope this chart brings you some peace and allows you to accumulate more or maybe not panic sell at a loss when there\u2019s something great right around the corner.\n\nChill, go grab a beer and TRY to realize when you\u2019re being impatient.

Or the market might actually believe the Fed and brush it off as transitory.\n\nBut if I was a bear right now, I'd have to put all my trust in Trump to be a man of his word and go through with his April 2nd tariffs, and at the same time, the market continue to panic over the same tariffs and consequences that it has known about for weeks.",

                "selftext": "If you've been following the recent crypto.com drama you probably have heard of the first crypto.com scam, the forced convert of tokens from Monaco to CRO before abandoning Monaco their ICO token entirely. You probably don't know just how bad this scam actually was though. When crypto.com forced the swap from Monaco to CRO, they gave Monaco holders less than 1% of the supply in the new token and giving over 99% of the supply to themselves.\n\n\\---\n\n**Before we go too deep, lets first refresh how this scam went down for anyone not yet familiar.**\n\nBefore crypto.com was crypto.com they were, Monaco. Monaco raised $26M in 2017 through an ICO of erc-20 token promising to launch crypto credit cards with \"big rewards\". This went absolutely nowhere and in 2018 the Monaco team pivoted and spent $12M of their remaining funds to purchase the crypto.com domain. Renaming the Monaco token the crypto.com token, and in 2020 the team abandoned this token all together in favor of their newer token which they had more control over - CRO. Giving Monaco holders a limited amount of time to swap from Monaco to CRO.  You can find a longer read on it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/biaud9/monaco_mco_raised_26_million_in_ico_and_promised/)\n\n# Now here's where things takes a really dark turn.\n\nMonaco had a circulating supply of: \\~31.587M token\n\nWhich can be confirmed with wayback machine from 2019.\n\n[https:\\/\\/web.archive.org\\/web\\/20190421005509\\/https:\\/\\/etherscan.io\\/token\\/0xb63b606ac810a52cca15e44bb630fd42d8d1d83d](https://preview.redd.it/m7o94sonmxpe1.png?width=437&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce45b2f8dac7b9127d4b2d40305992e3c211ec50)\n\nThe Monaco to CRO swap rate was 1 to 27.64. This swap rate can be confirmed from a now deleted August 2020 crypto.com blog post pulled from wayback machine\n\n[https:\\/\\/web.archive.org\\/web\\/20200927064258\\/https:\\/\\/blog.crypto.com\\/important-announcement-mco-swap\\/](https://preview.redd.it/quixwsh1nxpe1.png?width=771&format=png&auto=webp&s=5d5547b1c57f766736f044a58d8c4d05721a7295)\n\nIf we do the math: 31,587,682 \\* 27.6439 = 873.2M CRO was set aside for Monaco holders if everyone claimed (they didn't) - and Cro has a total supply of 100B tokens.\n\n* .873% of CRO went to Monaco holders\n* 99.127% of CRO went to Crypto.com\n\nOr in other words crypto.com stole 99.127% of the supply of the new token from existing Monaco holders on the forced swap to CRO.\n\n**Had Monaco holders been giving a proportionate amount of CRO based off the share they owned before the forced swap: Monaco holders would have been given 3,165.8 CRO for every 1 Monaco they owned. Instead they were given.... 27.6.**..\n\ncrypto.com stole over 99.1% of the new CRO token from Monaco holders and gave it to themselves. They then proceeded to dump that on crypto.com credit card buyers as a way to raise even more money, offering rewards that crypto.com knew wasn't sustainable. But that's a story for a different post.\n\n*Note: CRO supply had already been partially distributed by crypto.com prior to this forced swap so depending on how many Monaco crypto.com themselves owned they may not have never been able to give a perfectly equal distribution. However considering that CDC would later \"burn\" and \"unburn\" 70B CRO (70% of supply), it's safe to say they could have done a much fairer distribution to their OG token holders compared to the less than 1% that they actually distributed. Additionally CDC could have purchased Monaco until they had a share equal to the amount of CRO they had already distributed.*\n\n*Had this been stocks and not Crypto, Kris would probably have gone to jail for stealing 99% of tokens in a forced swap.*\n\n*-------*\n\nJust in case you thought the newest CRO remint scam was a one off, it seems to be the policy of crypto.com to rip off their token investors, by trying to extract maximum liquidity from them before stabbing them in the back with some trick manipulates and devalues their investment.",

Kris would resign as CEO and run away from the problem ultimately leaving an insolvent company that cost everyone else a lot of money. [More reading on Ensogo can be found here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/jf8bx4/history_of_kris_cryptocoms_ceo/). If for some reason you believe it couldn't be the same person [here is a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXzlJZectBY) of Kris shilling how great Ensogo is and how you should work for Ensogo just nine months before Ensogo declared bankruptcy in June of 2016.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9hvcm7h9phpe1.png?width=1228&format=png&auto=webp&s=9126ff5d094ca6d319d5e90b9b23bfbda36ddfe0\n\n**Monaco:**\n\nJust eleven months after Kris defrauded investors and users at Ensogo, Kris was back with another ~~revolutionary~~ idea, well a **copycat** of another popular idea. Whereas Ensogo attempted to compete with an established competitor (Groupon). Monaco (MCO) attempted to be the first to get in early into a budding field, Crypto Credit Cards.\n\nKris raised $26M on an ICO for an ERC-20 token called Monaco with plans to launch a Crypto credit card with special rewards for Monaco holders, although plans for this would ultimately stall with no signs of success, Kris would pivot a year later and use his remaining reserves to buy the crypto.com [domain for $12M](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/6/17540818/crypto-com-domain-matt-blaze-monaco-mco-cryptology-sale). This would lead to Monaco being renamed \"crypto.com\" token and then later being abandoned altogether for a new token called CRO. In 2020 Monaco holders were given a limited amount of time to exchange their MCO for CRO (a new token in which CDC owned nearly all the supply) and at a suboptimal rate. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/biaud9/monaco_mco_raised_26_million_in_ico_and_promised/)\n\n>To sum up this long tale, Monaco (MCO) raised tens of millions of dollars to launch a cryptocurrency Visa card... The company rebranded itself by buying the $12 million Crypto.com website and renamed Monaco (MCO) to Crypto.com, likely due to numerous users calling Monaco (MCO) a scam. [source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/biaud9/monaco_mco_raised_26_million_in_ico_and_promised/)\n\n**The crypto.com credit card debate:**\n\nAfter defrauding Monaco investors to buy the crypto.com domain, Kris would eventually launch a crypto credit card. Forcing credit card holders to buy CRO from crypto.com and lock it up to get rewards for holding the credit card. Kris repeated one of his tricks from his days at Ensogo, offering rewards that are too good to be true to onboard new users, then pull those rewards and create unhappy users.\n\n\\* For the crypto.com credit card it worked like this:\n\nSell your freshly minted CRO to Users (at no cost to yourself) -> Have them lock up their CRO for a year to get a credit card with \"great\" rewards, dripping the money they gave you back to them -> after a significant number of users are onboarded pull those rewards -> Leave unhappy users to deal with the consequences.\n\nMany users purchased a Credit Card locking up hundreds of thousands of CRO to get rewards, had those rewards slashed - and a year later the value of the token they locked up had lost 75%-90% of it's value costing users thousands to hundreds of thousands.\n\n**Notes:**\n\nPart 1 doesn't cover many sketchy things that crypto.com does like: hosting fake \"giveaways\", and taking advantage of new crypto investors with a \"gamified\" experience that **steals 15% of your money** with spread every time you make a full trade.\n\n\\---------------\n\n# Part 2: crypto.com just scammed CRO holders\n\nWhen crypto.com first launched CRO they minted 100B tokens, before eventually burning 70B tokens in 2021 (as a gimmick) [and said the final supply was 30B. ](https://cryptobriefing.com/70-billion-cro-burned-ahead-crypto-org-chain-launch/)On March 2nd 2025, just four years after the \"burn\" CDC made a proposal to remint the 70B tokens that they previously \"burned\" and to give it to themselves without making it clear how it would be used.\n\nThis proposal was put up to a \"democratic vote\" where nearly every user that wasn't CDC rejected the proposal. CDC proceeded to wait until the day before voting closed to steamroll the proposal - with CDC controlling 48% of the voting power and only 70% of validators voting this was all but guaranteed to pass and CDC will be minting 70B in CRO currently worth $5B to give to themselves, devaluing existing CRO holders.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fiyrftkffhpe1.png?width=1484&format=png&auto=webp&s=52a4c61fc6a881908e9c15a54597e86171d84c5e\n\nIn yet another attempt at manipulation immediately after CDC forced the remint of 70B tokens, they made another proposal to burn 50M tokens which they will surely pass for optics.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.mintscan.io\\/crypto-org\\/proposals\\/30](https://preview.redd.it/tnrru669ghpe1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=24ecd7d2ea1cb7c547515b0c461256c8caea3f1b)\n\nSo in other words instead of minting 70B Cro, they're just minting 69.95B Cro...\n\nKris was mostly silent to the backlash but a few days after the proposal went live they would eventually make one of their only statements saying they needed to mint 70B tokens to create sustainable flows on the \"demand side\"\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pdg2yf00hhpe1.png?width=612&format=png&auto=webp&s=8898f1383813d26d6f4a4d9edb9be68a450414f8\n\nOr in other words, CRO needed 70B tokens so that they could sell them to third parties for pure profit at no cost to themselves, diluting the value of all existing CRO holders who may want to sell. An absolute garbage excuse for anyone who knows how \"Crypto and Demand of Alts\" actually works.\n\nThis is completely contrary to what CDC said they would do in their white paper, use exchange profits to purchase additional CRO, creating an ecosystem where exchange profits are redistribute to CRO holders.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0ukzivkwhhpe1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=c345b611d1549fd59991bae0173fa6606f832d0c\n\n\\---------\n\n# Part 3: Why I think crypto.com is likely secretly insolvent\n\nThe question becomes why is Crypto.com abandoning their white paper to scam CRO holders, the simple answer is CDC just wants to mint more \"rewards\" for their users at no cost to themselves, but I **think** the truth is something much darker... I think crypto.com is likely secret insolvent.\n\nAfter FTX collapsed CDC seemed like it would be another exchange to fall given CDCs staking feature and similar business model. CDC survived a smaller exchange run and would eventually release an audit in early December, but just days later the firm that ran it said they weren't confident with the audits and would stop running them since they didn't show liabilities.\n\n[https:\\/\\/www.investopedia.com\\/mazars-suspends-crypto-clients-6931106](https://preview.redd.it/1g880c2clhpe1.png?width=980&format=png&auto=webp&s=68995b30dcfaa155b2dc469853bb03b4846503f2)\n\nCrypto.com hasn't had an audit since, **in fact a post from a week ago asking why CDC hasn't had an audit since 2022, has since been deleted or removed from** r/crypto_com\n\nGiven the fact that CDC is now blowing up what's left of their reputation to mint $5B it raises even more questions, why would CDC blow up what's left of their reputation? Ensogo did not have a money printer feature to save the company that Kris could use to prevent the company from going under when he ran it into the ground... crypto.com does and we already know from Ensogo that CDC leadership does not have a good track record with actually leading a company.\n\nOne of the only things Kris has attempted to repeatedly respond to since this drama began in early March is to aggressively assure users that CDC doesn't have any problems. While continuing to ignore any questions asking for a firm plan of how CDC will use the 70B CRO that they're reminting.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/9ur2wv9gnhpe1.jpg?width=592&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ff3c15453b434c0034ffdd10c17d265060a57cee\n\nKris went out of his way to try and tell users that all of these claims that CDC might be in trouble are \"just falsehoods\", but they're using the emergency built in money printer feature of their platform, they aren't releasing an audit, and their leadership has a very bad history of running companies into the ground\n\nSo it other words:\n\n* If a homeowner has a long history of catching his prior homes on fire\n* He won't let you look at the home to verify it's not on fire\n* The homeowners is aggressively telling people that there is no fire\n* He's rushing loads of water to his home\n* He isn't telling you why he needs the water\n\n**The house is probably on fire and you probably want to get your money out of that house.**\n\nThat appears to be the state of CDC at the moment. **There is no smoking gun because CDC isn't letting people see what's going on** by refusing to do more audits, although it's not guaranteed everything points to CDC likely being at least partially insolvent, and UNTIL THEY RELEASE AN AUDIT I **THINK** IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME THEY ARE. (don't trust verify)\n\nIf CDC did have a hole the two thing that might save CDC from going under in a bankrun is their insane fees to take money from the platform and the fact that they encourage users to lock up their funds on the platform which will hide the full extent of the damage by preventing many users from withdrawing during a bankrun (probably what helped save them in 2022 if they were insolvent).\n\nWho knows though, CDC has a plan to mint $5B and give it to themselves. If that works in a few years they might be able to dig themselves out of any hole that they may or may not currently be in.",

We all have things we value in life and loved ones and time are more precious and scarce than BTC.  My favorite BTC OG I think was transgender and his/her moon sex change operations -- not necessarily getting rich.  Here is an americanpegasus post from 10 years ago in 2015:\n\n\n> The next bubble, the $10k - $25k one will be epic... And horrible.\n\n> Basically, we are at a situation where bitcoin is becoming a precious, desirable, and scarce resource... But people just haven't realized it yet.\n\n> And when they do, it won't be a slow and steady March upward. It will be a monumental movement that will leave our heads spinning. One day we will go from $300 to $350, and we'll all be smiling and patting ourselves on the backs\n\n> Many panic and sell on the way up... And truthfully I don't know how high the next bubble can take bitcoin... At $10k the \"market cap\" will be about $150 billion... That's a lot, but about the valuation of a single large company.\n\nhttps://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2y97hl/the_next_bubble_the_10k_25k_one_will_be_epic_and/",
