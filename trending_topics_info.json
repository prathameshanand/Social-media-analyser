                "selftext": "Using Apple Configurator I setup a profile which removed access to Safari and disallowed certain applications from being used (social media, YouTube, etc), while still allowing access to the App Store to do updates on the applications I find to be essential. I did mess around with some minimalist \"launchers\"; however, I never liked their functionality, so I decided to get a gray wallpaper which matched the docking bay color to make it \"disappear,\" and then used the custom tint option to give the icons a darker color. While doing that I selected the option to make the icons larger so then the app/widget labels disappeared, giving the home screen a cleaner look.  Lastly, I went into the accessiblity settings to enable grayscale, which helps make apps less distracting when I'm using them.  \n\n\n\nThe only thing I hate is that I can't remove the clock form the status bar, but other than that I'm enjoying this setup.  \n\n\n\n   \n",

At this point I would just go for a cheap phone that can do everything, but it's too slow to make it addictive. The modifications are likely related to a DNS provider, in which case, you may be able to just switch your existing phone to that provider and have the same sites blocked. If it's not done through a DNS, then it could be something with way more invasive usage access (possible spyware). You might say that Samsung wouldn't allow that, but they have a lot of shady apps on their phones already, even more than Xiaomi",

I use my S23 as a \"mini tablet\" for banking and other apps that I need rarely, and I can honestly say that I hate typing on it. Not to mention, that my accuracy has plummeted over the few months of not using it daily. \n\n  \nButtons and the lack of them were what initially started me down the rabbit trail of dumbphones.",

                "selftext": "* **Phone**: Kyocera 902KC\n* **3DS** \u2013 For when it gets slow at work\n* **Innioasis Y1** \u2013 I like to have a separate music player so I get no interruptions\n* **Keys and Wallet** \u2013 For when I need my keys or wallet\n\nThis is also just a review of my experience using a Kyocera 902KC.\n\nI was able to purchase the phone on eBay for around $100 USD and it only took 3\u20134 days to get to my front door, which is impressive given I\u2019m living in the US. I set it up with Mint Mobile \u2013 it was only $45 for the cheapest plan and $15 a month after the first 3 months. The SIM was at my door in 2 days.\n\nSetting it up was pretty simple for me as I am pretty okay with ADB. I was able to set up the apps that I needed, which are just messaging apps so I can talk to my friends. The main apps that I am using are Discord and KakaoTalk. I was not able to figure out how to set up Discord on the phone, but I was able to set up **Allucord** no problem and it is working completely fine for now.\n\nAs for KakaoTalk, the most recent version is only available for Android 9+, but I was able to download and use a version from a few months ago and it seems to be working fine for now, though I am concerned for the future.\n\nSome of the default apps are pretty good IMO. I have found myself using the calendar app quite frequently, and the browser is not that bad. There are some sites that I have found that just think I am a bot, but for the most part it is usable.\n\n**Now for some of my issues with the phone:**\n\n* Texting is fine, but I like to have predictive text instead of using the default, so I installed **Traditional T9** on the phone. It works well in most cases, but when typing punctuation (like \u201cit\u2019s\u201d) it doesn\u2019t predict those characters and you need to select them manually.\n* Another issue I\u2019ve been facing is notifications. I would like to get better notifications, especially from KakaoTalk, as I have a friend in Korea who is 13 hours ahead of me and we can only call early in the morning or late at night. I have not been getting notifications for messages or calls.\n* Another issue with notifications is that I keep getting ones for things I don\u2019t need to know, like \u201cNew Personal Best\u201d from the pedometer and notifications telling me I dropped signal. The pedometer notification I found I can turn off in the app, but I\u2019ve yet to find where to disable the network one.\n* Other issues are more minor, like the fact that I can\u2019t install my banking app or the fact that Google doesn\u2019t let me log in to view my emails. But both of those I can just check when I\u2019m sitting at my computer, plus it\u2019s fewer distractions so it\u2019s not a big deal.\n\n**Other things I\u2019ve found that are nice:**\n\n* **Clima** \u2013 A weather app. The default weather app doesn\u2019t work, so this is a great alternative. It also has a widget you can put on the main screen so you can check the weather at a glance.\n* **OsmAnd** \u2013 A great app for maps. It uses OpenStreetMap and has turn-by-turn navigation with full offline support. Just download the map for your area and you\u2019re good to go. I recently had a trip about an hour away and had my friend pull up the route on Google Maps, but with how OsmAnd was routing me, it actually ended up being faster than Google for that trip lol.\n* I also highly recommend installing **F-Droid** as an \u201capp store.\u201d Tons of great apps you can install and I\u2019ve yet to have a problem with it.\n\n**More things I enjoy about the phone:**\n\n* The **exterior display** is fantastic for quickly checking the time and date.\n* The **shutter/manner mode button** on the side is really nice to turn on silent mode \u2013 I don\u2019t need to fiddle around with settings.\n* The **overall build quality** is quite nice. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to break with the usage I\u2019m putting it through.\n* **Battery life** is incredible. Coming from a smartphone that lasted me a day, this can go 3\u20134 days without needing to charge.\n* **Photo quality** is better than I expected and it\u2019s easy to just plug in and drag the photos off from a PC.\n\n**Closing thoughts:**\n\nI think it\u2019s a solid phone. Most of my complaints I can just work around one way or another. I still keep my smartphone around for things like my authenticator app and my Steam authenticator, but other than that I haven\u2019t really found any need or real want to use my smartphone over my dumb phone \u2013 which was the goal when getting this phone.\n\nThe only thing I\u2019ve really been missing is reading manga, so I\u2019ve been looking for an eInk reader so I can get the Shonen Jump app and continue reading One Piece. If anyone has recommendations, please feel free to leave them in the comments (or just tell me to go to r/ereader lol).",

                "selftext": " Hi guys, thanks to everyone who commented on my previous post!\n\nI think the Qin F21 Pro will be the best choice for me. I know I said I wanted a flip phone, but Android flip phones are usually too big. There are some Japanese ones like the Keycoca that I like, but I\u2019m not sure if calls will work with Greek carriers.\n\nSo yeah, the Qin F21 Pro seems like the best option for me. My plan is to install Google services so I can use a few essential apps: download Instagram Lite (I think it doesn\u2019t have Reels at all), my bank app, Google Maps, and Viber. Then I\u2019ll uninstall all the bloatware and even remove the Play Store.\n\nI want to use a dumb phone full time, but still be able to use apps for work or to talk with family when needed. This phone seems like the perfect balance for that. I plan to get it in September when I\u2019m done with the military, since right now I\u2019m mostly in the base and don\u2019t have access to a computer or anything\u2014so I still need to use my smartphone. I can\u2019t really go out anyway.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Got any tips for me? I\u2019d love to hear your opinions!",

Keep whatever you feel like is not potentially harming for your mind and time, reduce it step by step if you don\u2019t want to take a huge leap (which I wouldn\u2019t recommend you to take) and just have fun with it. A lot of people are taking about having a dumbphone being like you are lost in the middle of the woods with no water or supplies. It\u2019s still a phone, but it\u2019s a phone that has THE FUNCTIONALITY OF A PHONE, not a whole ecosystem of apps meant to monetise your time and data. Learn to love silence, peace and boredom. Learn how to make something useful out of boredom, how to deprive yourself of dopamine and have fun while doing so. Stay dumb! \ud83d\ude0e",

I don't really have a  social media addiction, my issue is with mental health, and social media affects me a lot\n\nThe benefits of using a smartphone are:\n\n- you still get decent functionality, like music streaming, camera, etc, so you don't need to find other devices to use\n\n- battery life improves\n\n- you can use an older device for more years\n\n- you can still look stuff up on the internet whenever you need to\n\n- voice calls are higher quality\n\n- group messages\n\nI'm sure there are others that I'm forgetting",

Right now I have a point and click camera I carry around with me, but I admit that I kind of miss the ease of having a good camera on my phone. It was just easier in some ways to have one device.",

I'm currently running my iphone se with a blank spaces launcher, screen set to black and white and I deleted every unnecessary app. Only have whatsapp, spotify, maps and that's about it. Even got a matte screenprotector to make it less shiny :Dd\n\nThe launcher is not the best and is paid, I am going to be trying others aswell to see if there are better (free?) options out there. The way it works on ios is that the launcher app creates widgets and the widget acts as your ui if that makes sense. \n\nOh and if you wanna go the extra mile you can block certain websites and apps from your isp settings or Idk what you call it but anyways you can restrict your internet to not allow problematic sites like reddit if you want to.",

Thoughts? Is a dumb phone the way to go? Are there smaller companies that make a phone with their own OS (so I don\u2019t need to deal with Google)?

It is small for typing, easier if you remember to switch to landscape, but I've found swipe typing pretty reliable.",

Em pouco tempo ele vai estar ruim de utilizar. \n\nOutra coisa \u00e9 pegar um comparador de pre\u00e7os (tipo Buscap\u00e9) e setar alguns alertas. Dia 15 de mar\u00e7o \u00e9 o dia do consumidor.

I did mess around with some minimalist \"launchers\"; however, I never liked their functionality, so I decided to get a gray wallpaper which matched the docking bay color to make it \"disappear,\" and then used the custom tint option to give the icons a darker color. While doing that I selected the option to make the icons larger so then the app/widget labels disappeared, giving the home screen a cleaner look.  Lastly, I went into the accessiblity settings to enable grayscale, which helps make apps less distracting when I'm using them.  \n\n\n\nThe only thing I hate is that I can't remove the clock form the status bar, but other than that I'm enjoying this setup.  \n\n\n\n   \n",

He needs to be able to make/receive calls at home but being partially sighted and having Parkinson\u2019s Disease means it literally just needs to be the massive buttons. \n\nThe bit I\u2019m struggling with is when the mode is activated, how do you get rid of the \u2018tap > open\u2019 if the screen locks??? There\u2019s no passcode on the phone - when in normal mode it opens without issue but in assistive access mode it requires extra steps to open. Frustrating as dad can\u2019t see the words or motion the gestures required. \n\nWhere am I going wrong? \n\n(He does have assistive tech for use in an emergency, but obviously don\u2019t want to use that service to call my mum to find out how long before she\u2019s home from the supermarket \ud83e\udee3)",

I like the SE as a smartphone, so if you want to have both and swap depending on the situation (which is what I do), I would recommend it. But the customization options on iPhone are still way more limited than on android in terms of making it look and feel like a dumb phone. As far as battery life goes, its definitely not great but mine still consistently lasts a full day, maybe a day and a half with moderate usage.",

People may also choose to create a new Apple ID on a browser with minimal data as well, so you can still install apps not linked to your prior profiles and if you need paid apps you could use prepaid debit cards paid in cash. Of course, it will all depend on use case. I personally don't bank on my phone but only at home in a dedicated device for this purpose behind a strong firewall, therefore I wouldn't need those apps. \n\n It all boils down to people's needs and specific concerns, so while it isn't impossible to setup without Apple ID, it may not be useful for the majority of users. If you're looking for privacy, you're better off with a Pixel running GrapheneOS, no need to create an account to use and you can still get apps through Aurora Store. This can't be be done as easily on an iPhone, but there are routes.",

No social media, no reddit, you can even remove the browser with ABD if you need to.",

I do take my dumb phone to work so I can listen to podcasts on the clock.

My main concern is privacy- I\u2019d like to not have to worry about data tracking and/or to have easily accessible privacy options to be able to opt out of \u201cdiagnostic\u201d data gathering, cross app tracking, etc. At the same time, I do need access to email on my phone, and preferably some work-related apps (Spotify would be ideal as well, but honestly I could live without it). Thoughts? Is a dumb phone the way to go? Are there smaller companies that make a phone with their own OS (so I don\u2019t need to deal with Google)? Any and all advice is appreciated, even if it\u2019s just \u201cyou\u2019re screwed\u201d. ",

                "selftext": "hello everyone! ive been off social media for a couple years now but realised i still spend so much time on my phone per day reading manga, webtoons etc & my mental health strongly urges me to live in the present more so ive bought a dumb phone the classic sharp aquos keitai 601sh in the pink colour so i can live the shoujo manga female protagonist of my dreams haha  \ni plan on also using my old samsung camera to take photos for uni if i need it & have hobbies, hangouts and things in place to fill up my time with the lack of a smartphone consuming my hours of readings subpar garbage content online \n\nwhile its on the way ive had some thoughts, does anyone here still use a smartphone sometimes for convenience purposes i.e for maps, cashless payment, hotspotting, uber etc? ideally i would prefer to just go cold turkey and not use my iphone but there are inconveniences that come with it\n\nfor those who have used a dumb phone for a long period of time, how do you navigate these inconveniences do you still use your smartphone occasionally or have you been able to manage without it? thanks for taking the time to read this :) ",

Most expensive part was buying new batteries for the camera. Dumbphone can hotspot to the tablet if I really need it, but so far I've only needed to do it once in the last year.",

                        "comment": "My experience as 18yom who went fully dumb about 1.5yr ago and had similar reservations; I kept my smartphone but found that I pretty much never needed it. My dumbphone has hotspot so the one time I did bring my smartphone out (for e-submitting some legal forms) I just hotspotted from it to the smartphone. I thought I'd struggle with not having maps but I just draw/write out the directions from my computer before leaving the house and manage just fine - it's gotten much easier and my ability to navigate has majorly improved. I take my wallet with my cards with me everywhere and use those or cash to pay, It's smaller than an iphone. Put my public transport card, IDs, membership cards, card for our socialised health service, library card, movie theatre card etc in there too so no need for a phone to prove that stuff. You don't need uber- you can just call a taxi service. You can find a local one that you like and just save their number. Uber does not treat its employees well in the first place and it's slowly pushing all the other ride services out of business because everyone thinks of uber as the only solution. I don't use uber or taxis frequently in the first place though and when I do I am typically with someone else and they just order it. If you do for some reason explicitly want to use uber you can call them too though(I think their # is 13uber), you don't need the app. I grew up with social media and iphones, my first phone was an iphone 8 so I never knew anything different and was expecting it to be pretty difficult. Maybe it was for about a month as I got used to a number keypad and not having everything in the world in my pocket but now I can't go back. Benefits definitely outweigh the slight learning curve. Can text like a beast now. Using it is second nature and I don't ever have the desire to take out my old phone anymore. If you're struggling with the thought of switching and your dumbphone is hotspot compatible you can always just move your sim to the dumbphone and keep your smartphone in the bag so you can still use it if needed but more intentionally. Even if it's not able to hotspot you can always use your old phone in wifi areas, screenshot map directions, or get hotspot from friends. After just about 6 months of using a dumb phone I actually stopped even feeling the need to bring my phone with me at all most of the times I left the house (where I live, melb aus, has free payphones everywhere if I need to call (I know this isn't the case everywhere so never bringing it with you is probably unrealistic esp for safety concerns if you're a girl)) but it was a huge shift from when I used to not even be able to sit in class or on a train without checking my phone once.\n\nHope this makes sense. Not too good with writing shit out haha. Hope I covered everything\n\n \\+ Another thing is I also noticed I didn't really need that much to 'replace' it. Everyone on here posts their EDCs and stuff but most of the time I leave the house I just grab phone and wallet, sometimes small notepad. All fits in one pocket. If you're in uni and bring a bag with you you'd probably need and be able to carry more but it really made me realise how unnecessary some things we think of as essential actually are.",

Sort of like going back in time to early 2000s, family computer room style. Channeling the early 2000s energy is helpful. At this point the only social media I use is Reddit which seems to be beneficial. The others like Facebook, Instagram, Tik Tok really suck you in mentally.\u00a0\n\n\nI wrote a text messaging service a year ago to help with maps, Google searches and a few other smart phone type things. A few weeks ago a released a version that is public with a limited subset of features if your interested. https://textmoresmarter.com\u00a0\nI'm releasing new features publically every week or two. DM if you want to beta test it.\u00a0\n\n\nDespite this I'll still carry my laptop around with me a fair amount to deal with work related stuff. My phone (punkt mp02) can turn into a Hotspot so I'll turn that on and hop onto my laptop if my job is expecting emails.\u00a0\n\n\nI definitely make more regular phone calls these days and use the Webex conference calls for work.\u00a0\n\n\nIf I'm traveling on vacation I'll break out my old android just to be safe in case of emergency. Especially if it's out of the country.\u00a0",

Camera quality isn\u2019t end all be all, of course I don\u2019t want it to be complete trash, but my priority would rather lie in the actual phone in how it performs in terms of reliability and battery life. I mostly use my phone for calls text and maps, and some streaming, not sure if that matters, as I\u2019ve never been too into phones/tech. \n\nI don\u2019t mind an older phone since my budget is around $500.

It provides fast and reliable\n5G connectivity, and it's the most\npower-efficient modem ever in an iPhone. We combined the incredible\npower efficiency of Apple silicon\nwith an all-new internal design for iPhone 16e that has been\noptimized for a larger battery. Together, it paves the way\nfor an unprecedented level of battery life\nin a 6.1-inch iPhone: an astonishing 26 hours\nof video playback.

You can catch up on long threads\nwith summaries or respond with a tap\nusing Smart Reply. With Writing Tools, you can\nproofread and refine your words virtually anywhere you type. Simply describe a change, like making a dinner invitation\nmore welcoming. And with some help\nfrom ChatGPT, you can even create\nthe dinner menu.

                "transcript": "Hey everyone. I'm Sam. I'm here to walk you through the new Galaxy S25 Series - built from the ground up for Galaxy AI. Galaxy S25 isn't just an upgrade, it's a true AI companion - design for you to find new ways to get things done, search, and communicate effortlessly. I could talk to you all day about these features, but... let's just go and find out. Hi there. You found everything you need? We love how these look! But we're curious about the new features. Yeah, can you show us what's changed? Of course! This is the new Galaxy S25. There's a lot I can show you, but let's start with the basics - wanna see how it uses AI to get things done? Sure! Well, let's say you want to try out a new restaurant tonight. What are you in the mood for? Mmm... Italian! But somewhere dog friendly. And with outdoor seating! I think we can find that! Let's send it to my friend, Luca. Now watch how S25 handles the whole request in one go. It's simple. Press. Talk. Done! Watch this: \"Find a pet-friendly Italian restaurant  with outdoor seating nearby and text it to Luca\" Here you go. That sounds so good! And, S25 already saved the spot and drafted a message to my friend. So, I can give the message a quick look,  and send when I'm happy. Oh! I need to get this. You should... You would so use it. That's so cool. So what else can S25 do? How about finding things you love to do, and adding plans to your calendar with a single ask. Sounds great! Are either of your sports fans? Huge Blue Stars fan! Let's take all the hard work out of going to games. It works the same way as before. Long press the side, then tell S25 what you need. \"Find the next 5 Blue Stars FC games, and put them in my calendar.\" And there you go... into the calendar, just like that. It would take forever to do that one by one... But Galaxy makes it quick and easy. On a roll. What else you got? Let's see. What kind of content are you looking at these days? Travel vlogs! I'm planning a trip to Seoul. You're gonna love it. So, here's a tip: you're probably spending a lot of time watching travel videos, and doing research. S25 can help you ask questions about the video, and save the answers as a note. It's tough keeping track of all the places mentioned in the video. Google Gemini can help save them all into one easy list. \"List the places mentioned in this video and save it as a Note.\" And there you go - all the tips, without the wait. That's a great travel partner. And a great study partner. You guys are both students, right? Yeah, we are! Galaxy S25 also makes studying so much easier, and it can help you upload whatever you're studying, and make it feel like a conversation. Just upload what you're studying, and tell this S25 to help you with it. \"Can you help me study this?\" \"Happy to! Let's start. What are mutations?\" I...don't know. Can you explain in a simple way? \"No problem! Imagine your body's instructions are all stored in this giant cookbook called DNA. Mutations are like typos in that cookbook.\" Cool! See what Galaxy S25 Ultra can do? It's like a tutor that keeps pushing you forward. Thanks! I had no idea phones had gotten this good. I'm glad we came by. I'm glad too. You wanna take it for a spin? Yea, thank you so much. Take a look, and let me know if you have any more questions. Hey there. You familiar with Galaxy? Yeah, I'm a Galaxy user. But I'm thinking about an upgrade. well then, you're looking at the right phone. I like what I see so far. But what sets S25 apart? The Galaxy S25 doesn't just add new features - it takes the ones you already love so much further. What's the feature you use most on your Galaxy now? Easy - Circle to Search. Me too! Did you know there is an upgrade? It makes searches so much more contextual. I'll show you how it works. Let's find something to circle... Tell me when to stop! And stoppppp! Good choice. So, you already know this part - Long press, Circle, and Search results. You can circle to search anything on your S25, without switching apps. But see this section here? That's the AI Overview. It's an AI-generated response of your search. Whoa, that is cool. You can get the information you need faster and easier with AI Overviews, then get right back to what you're doing. It was already my favorite. But this sounds amazing. You know what else sounds amazing? Using Circle to Search to find get music. You can use Circle to Search to find music? You can now. Ever watched a video with a great soundtrack and wanted to know what song is playing? Watch this. Press here, give it a second to listen... and then you go. Mystery solved! You think that's cool? You're gonna love this. Galaxy S25 can automatically recognize images on your screen, then pull out info you need  and even suggest next steps with Circle to Search. Just long press the home button... and it automatically identifies phone numbers, email addresses, or URL's on your screen. Then you just tap the chip to quick accomplish your task. No more copy pasting? And less time wasting. I could get used to this. Here's something else you can get used to. When you need to find an old photo and share with a friend, how do you search for it? The same way everyone does: scroll through 80,000 photos until I get the one I need. Same here! Until I had this. \"Find the photo of a dog in a bathrobe with a cucumber eye mask.\" That'll make scrolling through photos a lot easier. You want to know another way S25 can save you time? You can customize your phone, without searching through menus. After a day of searching and scrolling - sometimes I just say something like: \"My eyes are sore.\" And look... \"Eye comfort shield.\" Amazing. I had no idea you could do this. I guess all that's left now is picking the right color. Titanium Silverblue is going fast... But, no pressure! Quick question - what is this? That's the \"Now Bar\", it showcases on-going activities on the phone. You can see what music is playing, view sports scores, even see upcoming schedules! Plus, you can access the \"Now Brief\" straight from the lock screen. It gives you a personal summary of your day curated by Galaxy AI. You can use it to view your energy score, schedule and routines. All in one place? Exactly. I need this kind of organization in my life. Busy schedule? Plenty of work,  business trips abroad\u2026 Oh well, if you\u2019re traveling a lot, then here\u2019s feature you\u2019ll love:  Interpreter. It translates your conversations in real-time, on the spot. And it supports up to 20 languages. You can access Interpreter from the indicator bar. Just set your languages, tap the mic,  and start talking. And it even works offline, so if you\u2019re somewhere without a signal, you can still get your point across. (Swedish) Det funkar offline ocks\u00e5,\n(English) It even works offline, (Swedish) ifall du inte har t\u00e4ckning n\u00e4r du reser.\n(English) so if you\u2019re somewhere without a signal, you can still get your point across. That\u2019s so easy. Does it work on call assist well? Sure does, with Live Translate. If you want to Live Translate a call, Tap Call Assist \u2026 and turn on Live Translate. (Swedish) Hej. Det h\u00e4r samtalet \u00f6vers\u00e4tts och undertextas live.\n(English) Hello. This call is being translated and live captioned. Ingrid: Hello? Hey Ingrid, we\u2019re just testing out Live Translate from the Galaxy S25. Ingrid: Great to hear from you Sam! Call us any time. Thanks Ingrid! Let\u2019s catch up soon. That\u2019s so fast! What if the other person doesn\u2019t have a Galaxy? Totally fine. Live Translate works even if the other person isn\u2019t using a Galaxy device. So much easier than emailing back and forth. The thing with calls is I always forget something I\u2019m the same way. But S25 lets you record and summarize entire calls. It makes sure you don\u2019t miss a detail on a recorded call. It turns your calls into short, simple notes. After a call is over, just tap \u2018View Transcript\u2019. And \u2018Summarize',  and just like that, your entire conversation becomes an easy-to-read, point-by-point summary. Perfect notes, without the note taking. That\u2019s super convenient. But with all this on my phone I wonder is my data protected and private? Great question. Galaxy S25 is built to be secure. It uses a Personal Data Engine that collects your personal context only on-device, and protects it using Knox Vault. It also lets you choose your own personal data settings under \u201cSecurity and Privacy.\u201d So, control is literally in your hands. By tapping \u201cMore Privacy Settings\u201d, you can turn your Personal Data Engine on or off. That makes my life a lot easier. Thank you! Don\u2019t thank me. Galaxy S25 makes my job easier too. I hope you\u2019ve seen how you can use the Galaxy S25 Series in different ways. There are so many new and improved features to explore, so make sure to check out the timeline below  if you need to see any of our demonstrations again. And stay tuned for my next guided demo, where I\u2019ll be taking you through the upgraded camera. See you then.",

                        "comment": "Een Duits bedrijf hield van begin november 2024 tot begin maart 2025 een tentoonstelling over het menselijk lichaam in verschillende steden in Denemarken. Omdat de organisatoren van de tentoonstelling niet konden bewijzen waar de monsters vandaan kwamen en omdat er bewijs is van systematische vervolging van Falun Gong-beoefenaars en dissidenten, evenals van gedwongen orgaanroof in China, hadden veel mensen in Denemarken vragen.\r<br>\r<br>Deense parlementari\u00ebrs, overheidsfunctionarissen in de steden waar de tentoonstelling werd gehouden, de reguliere media, de huurders van de locatie en gewone mensen uitten allemaal hun bezorgdheid over de bron van de lijken. Veel mensen spraken hun steun uit voor de pogingen van Falun Gong-beoefenaars om de vervolging van de Chinese Communistische Partij (CCP) aan het licht te brengen.\r<br>\r<br>Volgens het onderzoek van de Wereldorganisatie voor onderzoek naar de vervolging van Falun Gong (WOIPFG) naar de bron van lijken in de Chinese plastinatie-industrie voor menselijke specimens: In 2008 plaatste partner Premier Exhibitions op verzoek van de procureur-generaal van de staat New York, Sui Hongjin [Noot: voorzitter van Dalian Hongfeng, een bedrijf dat Chinese lijken gebruikt om geplastineerde menselijke specimens te maken] een &#39;disclaimer&#39; op de offici\u00eble website van de tentoonstelling en de tentoonstellingssite van New York, waarin de oorspronkelijke bron van de menselijke specimens uit Dalian Hongfeng openbaar werd gemaakt: &#39;De overblijfselen van Chinese burgers of inwoners die in deze tentoonstelling worden tentoongesteld, komen van de Chinese politie.&#39;\r<br>\r<br>De eerste alinea van de disclaimer van First Exhibition Company in de Verenigde Staten luidt: De overblijfselen van Chinese burgers of inwoners die in deze tentoonstelling worden tentoongesteld, zijn afkomstig van de Chinese politie, die deze lichamen mogelijk uit Chinese gevangenissen heeft verkregen. Premier Exhibition kan niet onafhankelijk bevestigen dat de lichamen die u ziet niet van de lichamen zijn die in Chinese gevangenissen worden vastgehouden.\r<br>\r<br>Deense ambtenaren stellen de bron van de lichamen ter discussie\r<br>Morten Messerschmidt, Deens parlementslid en voorzitter van de Volkspartij (Dansk Folkeparti) was geschokt door de tentoonstelling. Op 7 februari stelde hij de minister van Volksgezondheid verschillende vragen over de wet, ethiek en het gebruik van organen van politieke gevangenen door China:\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>Morten Messerschmidt, parlementslid en voorzitter van de Volkspartij, stelde de minister van Volksgezondheid vragen over ethische kwesties rondom het tentoonstellen van lichamen.\r<br>\r<br>Vraag 275: \u201cKunt u uitleggen welke vergunningen en wettelijke procedures vereist zijn voor het tentoonstellen van menselijke resten in Denemarken en of het tentoonstellen van menselijke resten voldoet aan de toepasselijke wetgeving?\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Vraag 276: \u201cKan de minister uitleggen hoe het gebruik van menselijke resten in tentoonstellingen de toestemming van de overledene of zijn nabestaanden moet waarborgen?\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Vraag 277: \u201cZal de minister commentaar geven op de ethische overwegingen in verband met het commerci\u00eble gebruik van menselijke lichamen in tentoonstellingen zoals Human-Bodies, met inbegrip van de vraag of de huidige regels toereikend zijn, of dat er strengere regels zouden moeten komen voor dergelijke tentoonstellingen in Denemarken?\u201d\r<br>\r<br>Vraag nr. 278: &quot;Zal de minister onderzoeken of hij op de hoogte is van soortgelijke tentoonstellingen van menselijke lichamen internationaal die verband houden met het ontbreken van toestemming of illegale handel, en of de minister menselijke lichamen in dit opzicht zal onderzoeken? Is de minister in deze context op de hoogte van het gebruik van organen van politieke gevangenen door China?&quot;\r<br>\r<br>S\u00f8ren Espersen, een senior lid van de Deense Democratische Partij (Danmarksdemokraterne) en voorzitter van de Religieuze Commissie, vroeg de minister van Cultuur op 19 februari: \u201cKan met zekerheid worden vastgesteld dat alle lichamen en lichaamsdelen vrijwillig worden gedoneerd, niet afkomstig zijn van bijvoorbeeld ge\u00ebxecuteerde gevangenen in dictaturen, of afkomstig zijn van illegale orgaanhandel?\u201d\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>S\u00f8ren Espersen, een vooraanstaand lid van de Deense Democratische Partij, stelde de minister van Cultuur vragen over de lichamen.\r<br>\r<br>\u201cDe tentoonstelling is op meerdere plaatsen bekritiseerd vanwege twijfels dat de lichamen niet allemaal vrijwillig en voor een duidelijk doel zijn gedoneerd\u201d, schreef Thomas Krarup, directeur gezondheid, cultuur en zorg in de stad Randers, in een kennisgeving aan de overheidsinstanties",
